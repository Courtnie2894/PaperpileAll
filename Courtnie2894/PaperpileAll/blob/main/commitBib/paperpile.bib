  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: A novel neurostimulation system allows steering
              current in horizontal directions by combining segmented leads and
              multiple independent current control. The aim of this study was
              to evaluate directional DBS effects on parkinsonian motor
              features and adverse effects of subthalamic neurostimulation.
              METHODS: Seven PD patients implanted with the novel directional
              DBS system for bilateral subthalamic DBS underwent an extended
              monopolar review session during the first postoperative week, in
              which current thresholds were determined for rigidity control and
              stimulation-induced adverse effects using either directional or
              ring-mode settings. RESULTS: Effect or adverse effect thresholds
              were modified by directional settings for each of the 14 STN
              leads. Magnitude of change varied markedly between leads, as did
              orientation of optimal horizontal current steering. CONCLUSION:
              Directional current steering through chronically implanted
              segmented electrodes is feasible, alters adverse effect and
              efficacy thresholds in a highly individual manner, and expands
              the therapeutic window in a monopolar review as compared to
              ring-mode DBS. \copyright{} 2016 The Authors. Movement Disorders

              prosthetic device that acts and feels like one's own limb is a
              major goal in applied neuroscience. Recent studies in nonhuman
              primates have shown that motor control and sensory feedback can
              be achieved by connecting sensors in a robotic arm to electrodes
              implanted in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether
              electrical brain stimulation can be used to create a sense of
              ownership of an artificial limb. In this study on two human
              subjects, we show that ownership of an artificial hand can be
              induced via the electrical stimulation of the hand section of the
              somatosensory (SI) cortex in synchrony with touches applied to a
              rubber hand. Importantly, the illusion was not elicited when the
              electrical stimulation was delivered asynchronously or to a
              portion of the SI cortex representing a body part other than the
              hand, suggesting that multisensory integration according to basic
              spatial and temporal congruence rules is the underlying mechanism
              of the illusion. These findings show that the brain is capable of
              integrating ``natural'' visual input and direct
              cortical-somatosensory stimulation to create the multisensory
              perception that an artificial limb belongs to one's own body.
              Thus, they serve as a proof of concept that electrical brain
              stimulation can be used to ``bypass'' the peripheral nervous
              system to induce multisensory illusions and ownership of
              artificial body parts, which has important implications for

  abstract = "In an earlier report (Harman, Humphrey, \& Goodale, 1999), we
              demonstrated that observers who actively rotated
              three-dimensional novel objects on a computer screen later showed
              faster visual recognition of these objects than did observers who
              had passively viewed exactly the same sequence of images of these
              virtual objects. In Experiment 1 of the present study we showed
              that compared to passive viewing, active exploration of
              three-dimensional object structure led to faster performance on a
              ``mental rotation'' task involving the studied objects. In
              addition, we examined how much time observers concentrated on
              particular views during active exploration. As we found in the
              previous report, they spent most of their time looking at the
              ``side'' and ``front'' views (``plan'' views) of the objects,
              rather than the three-quarter or intermediate views. This strong
              preference for the plan views of an object led us to examine the
              possibility in Experiment 2 that restricting the studied views in
              active exploration to either the plan views or the intermediate
              views would result in differential learning. We found that
              recognition of objects was faster after active exploration
              limited to plan views than after active exploration of
              intermediate views. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate
              (1) that active exploration facilitates learning of the
              three-dimensional structure of objects, and (2) that the superior
              performance following active exploration may be a direct result
              of the opportunity to spend more time on plan views of the

              when exploiting a famous brain pattern called Steady-State
              Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Our design space relies on

               the reliability of moral intuitions, and even misconduct in

              incorporating personalized language models into brain-computer
              interface (BCI) communication technologies. METHODS: Fifteen
              semi-structured interviews and 51 online free response surveys
              were completed with individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative
              disease that could lead to loss of speech and motor skills. Each
              participant responded to questions after six hypothetical ethics
              vignettes were presented that address the possibility of building
              language models with personal words and phrases in BCI
              communication technologies. Data were analyzed with consensus
              coding, using modified grounded theory. RESULTS: Four themes were
              identified. (1) The experience of a neurodegenerative disease
              shapes preferences for personalized language models. (2) An
              individual's identity will be affected by the ability to
              personalize the language model. (3) The motivation for
              personalization is tied to how relationships can be helped or
              harmed. (4) Privacy is important to people who may need BCI
              communication technologies. Responses suggest that the inclusion
              of personal lexica raises ethical issues. Stakeholders want their
              values to be considered during development of BCI communication
              technologies. CONCLUSIONS: With the rapid development of BCI
              communication technologies, it is critical to incorporate
              feedback from individuals regarding their ethical concerns about
              the storage and use of personalized language models. Stakeholder
              values and preferences about disability, privacy, identity and

  abstract = "The current generation of virtual reality (VR) technologies has
              improved substantially from legacy systems, particularly in the
              resolution and latency of their visual display. The presentation
              of haptic cues remains challenging, however, because haptic
              systems do not generalise well over the range of stimuli (both
              tactile and proprioceptive) normally present when interacting
              with objects in the world. This study investigated whether
              veridical tactile and proprioceptive cues lead to more efficient
              interaction with a virtual environment. Interaction in the world
              results in spatial and temporal correlation of tactile,
              proprioceptive and visual cues. When cues in VR are similarly
              correlated, observers experience a sense of embodiment and agency
              of their avatars. We investigated whether sensorimotor
              performance was mediated by embodiment of the avatar hands.
              Participants performed a Fitts' tapping task in different
              conditions (VR with no haptics, active haptics, passive haptics,
              and on a real touchscreen). The active-haptic condition provided
              abstract tactile cues and the passive haptic condition provided
              veridical tactile and proprioceptive cues. An additional (hybrid
              haptics) condition simulated an ideal passive haptic system.
              Movement efficiency (throughput) and embodiment were higher for
              the passive than for the active and no-haptics conditions.
              However, components of embodiment (perceived agency and
              ownership) did not predict unique variance in throughput.
              Improved sensorimotor performance and ratings of presence and
              realism support the use of passive haptics in VR environments
              where objects are in known and stable locations, regardless of
              whether performance was mediated by the sense of embodiment.",

               movement. This is achieved through motor-imagery (MI) practice,

  abstract = "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable people with paralysis to
              communicate with their environment. Motor imagery can be used to
              generate distinct patterns of cortical activation in the
              electroencephalogram (EEG) and thus control a BCI. To elucidate
              the cortical correlates of BCI control, users of a sensory motor
              rhythm (SMR)-BCI were classified according to their BCI control
              performance. In a second session these participants performed a
              motor imagery, motor observation and motor execution task in a
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. Group
              difference analysis between high and low aptitude BCI users
              revealed significantly higher activation of the supplementary
              motor areas (SMA) for the motor imagery and the motor observation
              tasks in high aptitude users. Low aptitude users showed no
              activation when observing movement. The number of activated
              voxels during motor observation was significantly correlated with
              accuracy in the EEG-BCI task (r=0.53). Furthermore, the number of
              activated voxels in the right middle frontal gyrus, an area
              responsible for processing of movement observation, correlated
              (r=0.72) with BCI-performance. This strong correlation highlights
              the importance of these areas for task monitoring and working
              memory as task goals have to be activated throughout the BCI
              session. The ability to regulate behavior and the brain through
              learning mechanisms involving imagery such as required to control
              a BCI constitutes the consequence of ideo-motor co-activation of
              motor brain systems during observation of movements. The results
              demonstrate that acquisition of a sensorimotor program reflected
              in SMR-BCI-control is tightly related to the recall of such
              sensorimotor programs during observation of movements and
              unrelated to the actual execution of these movement sequences.",

               Closing the loop with sensors to provide feedback may increase

               persons with and without Multiple Sclerosis (MS) when exposed to
               cybersickness-provoking Virtual Reality (VR). Cybersickness is a
               set of discomforts and commonly triggered by VR exposure. It has
               symptoms similar to motion sickness, such as dizziness, nausea,
               and disorientation etc. Although cybersickness has been studied
               for decades, populations with neurological disabilities, such as
               MS, have remained minimally studied. Cybersickness could have
               negative impact on effectiveness of VR-based rehabilitation
               systems and limit the accessibility of VR for persons with
               disabilities. MS can disrupt communication between neurons
               (signal carrying nerve cells) from different areas of the brain.
               Cybersickness also can affect brain signals, for example,
               frequency powers may change due to cybersickness. This study
               investigates the combination of MS and cybersickness in terms of
               brain signals. To investigate the effect of cybersickness on
               participants' brain signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) data
               were recorded before, during and after exposure to a
               cybersickness-provoking VR driving simulation. The EEG data
               suggests that in response to cybersickness-provoking VR
               exposure, participants with MS have mostly shown similar changes
               in brain activity with different magnitudes than participants
               without MS. Also, for at least one scalp location we have found
               completely opposite brain signals in MS-Group when compared to
               Non-MS-Group. Difference in magnitude or completely different
               trend in brain signals can imply that cybersickness affects
               persons with MS differently than persons without MS and may be
               different cybersickness reduction techniques are required for
               different populations.",

              risk for psychosis have suggested that virtual reality (VR)
              environments may be used to investigate social and psychological
              mechanisms of psychosis. One small study reported that VR can
              safely be used in individuals with current persecutory delusions.
              The present pilot study investigated the feasibility and
              potential negative side effects of exposure to different virtual
              social risk environments in patients with first episode psychosis
              and in healthy controls. Seventeen patients with first episode
              psychosis (FEP) and 24 healthy control subjects (HC) participated
              in four virtual experiments during which they walked for 3.5-4
              minutes in a virtual caf{\'e}, looking for avatars with digits on
              their clothing. The level of paranoid thoughts, as well as
              psychological, physiological, and behavioral correlates of
              paranoid thoughts, were measured in different virtual social risk
              environments, manipulating two factors: population density and
              ethnicity of avatars. FEP and HC frequently had paranoid thoughts
              about avatars. Paranoia in the real world correlated strongly
              with paranoid thoughts about avatars in virtual environments
              (Spearman's $\rho$=0.67 and 0.54 in FEP and HC respectively,
              p<0.01). FEP kept a smaller distance to avatars than HC. In FEP,
              but not in HC, galvanic skin response was significantly stronger
              in virtual environments with avatars of other ethnicity than in
              the own ethnicity condition. These results suggest that VR is an
              acceptable and sufficiently realistic method to use in patients
              with first episode psychosis. VR research may help to increase

  abstract = "The perception of one's own body depends on the dynamic
              integration of signals from different sensory modalities. Earlier
              studies have shown that visual, tactile, and proprioceptive
              information contributes to this process. However, little is known
              about the role of auditory cues in the multisensory integration
              of bodily signals. To address this issue, we studied the effect
              of auditory feedback on the rubber-hand illusion and the somatic
              version of this illusion. In each experiment, we tested 30
              healthy participants using four different conditions: synchronous
              touches without auditory cues (original illusion), asynchronous
              touches without auditory cues (original control), synchronous
              touches with synchronous auditory cues (illusion positively
              modulated by sound), and synchronous touches with asynchronous
              auditory cues (illusion negatively modulated by sound). For the
              classic rubber-hand illusion, we found that synchronous auditory
              cues made the illusion stronger compared with asynchronous
              auditory cues, as evidenced by both the results of the
              questionnaires and proprioceptive drift. In both versions of the
              illusion, proprioceptive drift indicated that the synchronous
              auditory cues enhanced the illusion compared with the condition
              without auditory feedback and that the asynchronous auditory cues
              reduced the illusion compared with the nonauditory condition.
              Taken together, these results demonstrate that auditory cues
              modulate the rubber-hand illusion, which suggests that auditory
              information is used in the formation of the coherent multisensory
              representation of one's own body. (PsycINFO Database Record",

              conditions of movement. An apparatus was devised that would
              synchronise visual with felt movement in an active condition and
              a passive condition. An asynchronous condition was included as a
              control in which visual and felt movement were purposely

              relations uniting self-motion with a visual display of that
              motion. Previous research has shown that 5-mo-old infants can
              detect the invariant relationship between their own leg motion
              and a video display of that motion. The 1st 3 experiments showed
              that the 5-mo-olds discriminated between a perfectly contingent
              live display of their own leg motion and a noncontingent display
              of self or a peer. They showed this discrimination by
              preferential fixation of the noncontingent display. This effect
              was evident even when an S's direct view of his/her own body was
              occluded, eliminating video image discrimination on the basis of
              an intramodal visual comparison between the sight of self-motion
              and the video display of that motion. These results suggest that
              the contingency provided by a live display of one's body motion
              is perceived by detecting the invariant intermodal relationship
              between proprioceptive information for motion and the visual
              display of that motion. The detection of these relations may be
              fundamental to the development of self-perception in infancy.
              Although 3-mo-olds did not show significant discrimination of the
              contingent and noncontingent displays in Exp IV, they did show
              significantly more extreme looking proportions to the 2 displays
              than did the 5-mo-olds. This may reflect the infant's progression

              invested into improving and mass producing VR and augmented
              reality products. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the
              present study is to explore the potential of immersive VR to make
              physical therapy/occupational therapy less painful, more fun, and
              to help motivate patients to cooperate with their hand therapist.
              DISCUSSION: The following topics are covered: a) psychological
              influences on pain perception, b) the logic of how VR analgesia
              works, c) evidence for reduction of acute procedural pain during
              hand therapy, d) recent major advances in VR technology, and e)
              future directions-immersive VR embodiment therapy for phantom
              limb (chronic) pain. CONCLUSION: VR hand therapy has potential
              for a wide range of patient populations needing hand therapy,
              including acute pain and potentially chronic pain patients. Being
              in VR helps reduce the patients' pain, making it less painful for
              patients to move their hand/fingers during hand therapy, and
              gamified VR can help motivate the patient to perform therapeutic
              hand exercises, and make hand therapy more fun. In addition, VR
              camera-based hand tracking technology may be used to help
              therapists monitor how well patients are doing their hand therapy
              exercises, and to quantify whether adherence to treatment
              increases long-term functionality. Additional research and
              development into using VR as a tool for hand therapist is
              recommended for both acute pain and persistent pain patient

               Heilig proposed a multisensory immersive experienced called the
               Sensorama, and Sutherland and Sproull had created a stereoscopic
               head mounted display (HMD) (Berryman 2012; Srivastava et al.
               2014). The term VR was coined more than 30 years ago by Jaron
               Lanier and commercial games were distributed to the public as
               early as 1989 by Mattel (in the US, and by PAX in Japan) for its
               PowerGlove™ and Nintendo's failed Virtual Boy™ was released in
               1995. Clinical VR applications were proposed as early as the mid
               1990's by Lamson, Pugnetti, Rothbaum, Riva, Rizzo, Weiss, and
               Wiederhold (named in alphabetical order), among others.

               uncertainty and explainability to improve the reliability of
               deep learning predictions. In the field of image processing,
               previous methods can be intuitively understood by humans and can
               be used to evaluate the reliability of predictions. However,
               they cannot be applied to complex time series prediction because
               of the difficulty for humans in evaluating the reliability of
               predictions. Previous methods focused on either uncertainty or
               explainability; therefore, the evaluation of the methods and
               predictions depended only on human knowledge. In this paper, we
               propose a time series prediction method focusing on both
               uncertainty and explainability. Our method allows the evaluation
               of predictions from multiple perspectives by using uncertainty
               and explainability without relying solely on human knowledge.
               The explanation obtained from the unimodal distribution
               prediction model is unreliable because the predictive
               distribution of time series prediction can be an inherently
               multi-peaked. The unimodal model does not correspond to the
               actual phenomenon and does not match with human knowledge.
               Therefore, we solve the time series prediction as a multi-class
               classification problem. From the verification of the proposed
               model with real time series, we confirm the effectiveness of the
               (1) prediction based on the expected value of the class
               probability distribution, (2) confidence of the prediction, and
               (3) series importance based on the confidence. Moreover, we show

  abstract = "This research focuses on the exploration of software and methods
              to support natural interaction within a virtual environment.
              Natural interaction refers to the ability of the technology to
              support human interactions with computer generated simulations
              that most accurately reflect interactions with real objects. Over
              the years since the invention of computer-aided design tools,
              computers have become ubiquitous in the product design process.
              Increasingly, engineers and designers are using immersive virtual
              reality to evaluate virtual products throughout the entire design
              process. The goal of this research is to develop tools that
              support verisimilitude, or likeness to reality, particularly with
              respect to human interaction with virtual objects. Increasing the
              verisimilitude of the interactions and experiences in a virtual
              environment has the potential to increase the external validity
              of such data, resulting in more reliable decisions and better
              products. First, interface software is presented that extends the
              potential reach of virtual reality to include low-cost,
              consumer-grade motion sensing devices, thus enabling virtual
              reality on a broader scale. Second, a software platform, VR
              JuggLua, is developed to enable rapid and iterative creation of
              natural interactions in virtual environments, including by
              end-user programmers. Based on this software platform, the focus
              of the rest of the research is on supporting virtual assembly and
              decision making. The SPARTA software incorporates a powerful
              physically-based modeling simulation engine tuned for haptic
              interaction. The workspace of a haptic device is both virtually
              expanded, though an extension to the bubble technique, and
              physically expanded, through integration of a haptic device with
              a multi-directional mobile platform. Finally, a class of hybrid
              methods for haptic collision detection and response is
              characterized in terms of five independent tasks. One such novel
              hybrid method, which selectively restores degrees of freedom in
              haptic assembly, is developed and assessed with respect to
              low-clearance CAD assembly. It successfully maintains the high
              1000 Hz update rate required for stable haptics unlike previous
              related approaches. Overall, this work forms a pattern of
              contributions towards enabling natural interaction for virtual
              reality and advances the ability to use an immersive environment
              in decision making during product design.",

              stimulation (DBS) lead is known to be highly dynamic following
              implantation, which may have implications on the interpretation
              of intraoperatively recorded local field potentials (LFPs). We
              characterized beta-band LFP dynamics following implantation of a
              directional DBS lead in the sensorimotor subthalamic nucleus
              (STN), which is a primary target for treating Parkinson's
              disease.Approach.Directional STN-DBS leads were implanted in four
              healthy, non-human primates. LFPs were recorded over two weeks
              and again 1-4 months after implantation. Impedance was measured
              for two weeks post-implant without stimulation to compare the
              reactive tissue response to changes in LFP oscillations.
              Beta-band (12-30 Hz) peak power was calculated from the LFP power
              spectra using both common average referencing (CAR) and intra-row
              bipolar referencing (IRBR).Results.Resting-state LFPs in two of
              four subjects revealed a steady increase of beta power over the
              initial two weeks post-implant whereas the other two subjects
              showed variable changes over time. Beta power variance across
              days was significantly larger in the first two weeks compared to
              1-4 months post-implant in all three long-term subjects. Further,
              spatial maps of beta power several hours after implantation did
              not correlate with those measured two weeks or 1-4 months
              post-implant. CAR and IRBR beta power correlated across short-
              and long-term time points. However, depending on the time period,
              subjects showed a significant bias towards larger beta power
              using one referencing scheme over the other. Lastly,
              electrode-tissue impedance increased over the two weeks
              post-implant but showed no significant correlation to beta
              power.Significance.These results suggest that beta power in the
              STN may undergo significant changes following DBS lead
              implantation. DBS lead diameter and electrode recording
              configurations can affect the post-implant interpretation of
              oscillatory features. Such insights will be important for
              extrapolating results from intraoperative and externalized LFP

              are capable of steering current in the direction of any 1 of 3
              segments, can result in a wider therapeutic window by directing
              current away from unintended structures, particularly, the
              corticospinal tract (CST). It is unclear whether the use of motor
              evoked potentials (MEPs) is feasible during DBS surgery via
              stimulation of individual contacts/segments in order to quantify
              CST activation thresholds and optimal contacts/segments
              intraoperatively. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using
              MEP to identify CST thresholds for ring and individual segments
              of the DBS lead under general anesthesia. METHODS: MEP testing
              was performed during pulse generator implantation under general
              anesthesia on subjects who underwent DBS lead implantation into
              the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Stimulation of each ring and
              segmented contacts of the directional DBS lead was performed
              until CST threshold was reached. Stereotactic coordinates and
              thresholds for each contact/segment were recorded along with the
              initially activated muscle group. RESULTS: A total of 34
              hemispheres were included for analysis. MEP thresholds were
              recorded from 268 total contacts/segments. For segmented contacts
              (2 and 3, respectively), the mean highest CST thresholds were
              2.33 and 2.62 mA, while the mean lowest CST thresholds were 1.7
              and 1.89 mA, suggesting differential thresholds in relation to
              CST. First dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis (34\%
              each) were the most commonly activated muscle groups. CONCLUSION:
              MEP threshold recording from segmented DBS leads is feasible. MEP
              recordings can identify segments with highest CST thresholds and
              may identify segment orientation in relation to CST.",

              (DBS) relieves symptoms in dystonia patients. However, the
              physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully
              understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes
              cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the
              modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with
              single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral
              implantation of GPi DBS. METHODS: The cortical evoked potentials
              from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial
              magnetic stimulation with a conditioning test paired-pulse
              paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the
              primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor
              cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative
              stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor
              cortical stimulation at specific time intervals. RESULTS: GPi
              stimulation produced 2 peaks of cortical evoked potentials with
              latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 milliseconds in the motor cortical area.
              Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 milliseconds after
              single-pulse GPi DBS, and cortical inhibition was observed after
              a ∼25-millisecond interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation
              with cortical stimulation at these 2 time intervals produced
              long-term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.
              INTERPRETATION: Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability
              and plasticity at specific time intervals. These effects may be
              related to the mechanism of action of DBS. Combination of DBS
              with cortical stimulation with appropriate timing has therapeutic
              potential and could be explored in the future as a method to

               our moral sense and our need for a feeling of natural justice,

               them is one of its main points. The essay traces a developing

               written. And yet there is a curious puzzle at its center. The
               figure to whom Shakespeare gives more lines than anyone except
               the king---Edgar---has often seemed little more than a blank,
               ignored and unloved, a belated moralizer who, try as he may, can
               never truly speak to the play's savaged heart. He saves his
               blinded father from suicide, but even this act of care is
               shadowed by suspicions of evasiveness and bad faith. In Poor
               Tom, Simon Palfrey asks us to go beyond any such received
               understandings---and thus to experience King Lear as never
               before. He argues that the part of Edgar is Shakespeare's most
               radical experiment in characterization, and his most exhaustive
               model of both human and theatrical possibility. The key to the
               Edgar character is that he spends most of the play disguised,
               much of it as ``Poor Tom of Bedlam,'' and his disguises come to
               uncanny life. The Edgar role is always more than one person; it
               animates multitudes, past and present and future, and gives life
               to states of being beyond the normal reach of the
               senses---undead, or not-yet, or ghostly, or possible rather than
               actual. And because the Edgar role both connects and retunes all
               of the figures and scenes in King Lear, close attention to this
               particular part can shine stunning new light on how the whole
               play works. The ultimate message of Palfrey's bravura analysis
               is the same for readers or actors or audiences as it is for the
               characters in the play: see and listen feelingly; pay attention,

               the observation of room-temperature superconductivity1,2.
               Recently, high-temperature conventional superconductivity in
               hydrogen-rich materials has been reported in several systems
               under high pressure3--5. An important discovery leading to
               room-temperature superconductivity is the pressure-driven
               disproportionation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to H3S, with a
               confirmed transition temperature of 203 kelvin at 155
               gigapascals3,6. Both H2S and CH4 readily mix with hydrogen to
               form guest--host structures at lower pressures7, and are of
               comparable size at 4 gigapascals. By introducing methane at low
               pressures into the H2S + H2 precursor mixture for H3S, molecular
               exchange is allowed within a large assemblage of van der Waals
               solids that are hydrogen-rich with H2 inclusions; these
               guest--host structures become the building blocks of
               superconducting compounds at extreme conditions. Here we report
               superconductivity in a photochemically transformed carbonaceous
               sulfur hydride system, starting from elemental precursors, with
               a maximum superconducting transition temperature of 287.7 $\pm$
               1.2 kelvin (about 15 degrees Celsius) achieved at 267 $\pm$ 10
               gigapascals. The superconducting state is observed over a broad
               pressure range in the diamond anvil cell, from 140 to 275
               gigapascals, with a sharp upturn in transition temperature above
               220 gigapascals. Superconductivity is established by the
               observation of zero resistance, a magnetic susceptibility of up
               to 190 gigapascals, and reduction of the transition temperature
               under an external magnetic field of up to 9 tesla, with an upper
               critical magnetic field of about 62 tesla according to the
               Ginzburg--Landau model at zero temperature. The light, quantum
               nature of hydrogen limits the structural and stoichiometric
               determination of the system by X-ray scattering techniques, but
               Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the chemical and structural
               transformations before metallization. The introduction of
               chemical tuning within our ternary system could enable the
               preservation of the properties of room-temperature
               superconductivity at lower pressures. Room-temperature
               superconductivity is observed in a photochemically synthesized

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: An optimal level of vibrotactile stimulation has been
              shown to improve sensorimotor control in healthy and diseased
              individuals. However, the underlying neurophysiological
              mechanisms behind the enhanced motor performance caused by
              vibrotactile stimulation are yet to be fully understood.
              Therefore, here we aim to evaluate the effect of a cutaneous
              vibration on the firing behavior of motor units in a condition of
              improved force steadiness. APPROACH: Participants performed a
              visuomotor task, which consisted of low-intensity isometric
              contractions of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, while
              sinusoidal (175 Hz) vibrotactile stimuli with different
              intensities were applied to the index finger. High-density
              surface electromyogram was recorded from the FDI muscle, and a
              decomposition algorithm was used to extract the motor unit spike
              trains. Additionally, computer simulations were performed using a
              multiscale neuromuscular model to provide a potential explanation
              for the experimental findings. MAIN RESULTS: Experimental
              outcomes showed that an optimal level of vibration significantly
              improved force steadiness (estimated as the coefficient of
              variation of force). The decreased force variability was
              accompanied by a reduction in the variability of the smoothed
              cumulative spike train (as an estimation of the neural drive to
              the muscle), and the proportion of common inputs to the FDI motor
              nucleus. However, the interspike interval variability did not
              change significantly with the vibration. A mathematical approach,
              together with computer simulation results suggested that
              vibrotactile stimulation would reduce the variance of the common
              synaptic input to the motor neuron pool, thereby decreasing the
              low frequency fluctuations of the neural drive to the muscle and
              force steadiness. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that the
              decreased variability in common input accounts for the

              the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, another brain network that is
              crucial for learning and memory3-5. Here, using

              cells grouped newly learned rewarded cues with a pre-learned
              rewarded cue, but separated them from a pre-learned unrewarded
              cue. Optogenetic inhibition of fan cells impaired the learning of
              new associations while sparing the retrieval of pre-learned

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The spacing or distribution of stimulation pulses of
              therapeutic neurostimulation waveforms-referred to here as the
              Temporal Pattern (TP)-has emerged as an important parameter for
              tuning the response to deep-brain stimulation and intracortical
              microstimulation (ICMS). While it has long been assumed that
              modulating the TP of ICMS may be effective by altering the rate
              coding of the neural response, it is unclear how it alters the
              neural response at the neural network level. The present study is
              designed to elucidate the neural response to TP at the network
              level. APPROACH: We use in vivo two-photon imaging of ICMS in
              mice expressing the calcium sensor Thy1-GCaMP or the glutamate
              sensor hSyn-iGluSnFr to examine the layer II/III neural response
              to stimulations with different TPs. We study the neuronal calcium
              and glutamate response to TPs with the same average frequency
              (10Hz) and same total charge injection, but varying degrees of
              bursting. We also investigate one control pattern with an average
              frequency of 100Hz and 10X the charge injection. MAIN RESULTS:
              Stimulation trains with the same average frequency (10 Hz) and
              same total charge injection but distinct temporal patterns
              recruits distinct sets of neurons. More-than-half (60\% of 309
              cells) prefer one temporal pattern over the other. Despite their
              distinct spatial recruitment patterns, both cells exhibit similar
              ability to follow 30s trains of both TPs without failing, and
              they exhibit similar levels of glutamate release during
              stimulation. Both neuronal calcium and glutamate release train to
              the bursting TP pattern (~21-fold increase in relative power at
              the frequency of bursting. Bursting also results in a
              statistically significant elevation in the correlation between
              somatic calcium activity and neuropil activity, which we explore
              as a metric for inhibitory-excitatory tone. Interestingly,
              soma-neuropil correlation during the bursting pattern is a
              statistically significant predictor of cell preference for TP,
              which exposes a key link between inhibitory-excitatory tone.
              Finally, using mesoscale imaging, we show that both TPs result in
              distal inhibition during stimulation, which reveals complex
              spatial and temporal interactions between temporal pattern and
              inhibitory-excitatory tone in ICMS. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results may
              ultimately suggest that TP is a valuable parameter space to
              modulate inhibitory-excitatory tone as well as distinct network
              activity in ICMS. This presents a broader mechanism of action
              than rate coding, as previously thought. By implicating these
              additional mechanisms, TP may have broader utility in the clinic
              and should be pursued to expand the efficacy of ICMS therapies.",

  abstract = "Objective.Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in somatosensory
              cortex can restore sensation to people with spinal cord injury.
              However, the recording quality from implanted microelectrodes can
              degrade over time and limitations in stimulation longevity have
              been considered a potential barrier to the clinical use of ICMS.
              Our objective was to evaluate recording stability of
              intracortical electrodes implanted in the motor and somatosensory
              cortex of one person. The electrodes in motor cortex had platinum
              tips and were not stimulated, while the electrodes in
              somatosensory cortex had sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF)
              tips and were stimulated. Additionally, we measured how well ICMS
              was able to evoke sensations over time.Approach. We implanted
              microelectrode arrays with SIROF tips in the somatosensory cortex
              (SIROF-sensory) of a human participant with a cervical spinal
              cord injury. We regularly stimulated these electrodes to evoke
              tactile sensations on the hand. Here, we quantify the stability
              of these electrodes in comparison to non-stimulated platinum
              electrodes implanted in the motor cortex (platinum-motor) over
              1500 days with recorded signal quality and electrode impedances.
              Additionally, we quantify the stability of ICMS-evoked sensations
              using detection thresholds.Main results. We found that recording
              quality, as assessed by the number of electrodes with
              high-amplitude waveforms (>100µV peak-to-peak), peak-to-peak
              voltage, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio, decreased over time on
              SIROF-sensory and platinum-motor electrodes. However,
              SIROF-sensory electrodes were more likely to continue to record
              high-amplitude signals than platinum-motor electrodes.
              Interestingly, the detection thresholds for stimulus-evoked
              sensations decreased over time from a median of 31.5$\mu$A at day
              100-10.4$\mu$A at day 1500, with the largest changes occurring
              between day 100 and 500.Significance. These results demonstrate
              that ICMS in human somatosensory cortex can be provided over long
              periods of time without deleterious effects on recording or
              stimulation capabilities. In fact, the sensitivity to stimulation
              improved over time.",

              question of brain organization. Recent work has shown that this
              operation involves the cooperative interaction of large neuronal
              populations. A population vector method, by transforming neuronal
              activity to the spatial domain, was used to visualize the motor
              cortical representation of the hand's trajectory made by rhesus
              monkeys as they drew spirals. Hand path was accurately reflected
              by a series of population vectors calculated throughout the task.
              A psychophysical rule relating speed to curvature, the ``power
              law,'' was found in this cortical representation. The relative
              timing between each population vector and the corresponding
              portion of the movement was variable. The population vectors only
              preceded the movement in a predictive manner in portions of the
              spiral where the radius of curvature was greater than 6
              centimeters. These results show that the movement trajectory is
              an important determinant of motor cortical activity and that this
              aspect of motor cortical activity may contribute only to discrete
              portions of the drawing movement.",

              measure specific features of brain activity and translate them
              into control signals that drive an output. The sensor modalities
              that have most commonly been used in BCI studies have been
              electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from the scalp and
              single-neuron recordings from within the cortex. Over the past
              decade, an increasing number of studies has explored the use of
              electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded directly from the
              surface of the brain. ECoG has attracted substantial and
              increasing interest, because it has been shown to reflect
              specific details of actual and imagined actions, and because its
              technical characteristics should readily support robust and
              chronic implementations of BCI systems in humans. This review
              provides general perspectives on the ECoG platform; describes the
              different electrophysiological features that can be detected in
              ECoG; elaborates on the signal acquisition issues, protocols, and

              approaches to ECoG-BMIs were either based on classification of

              Thus, ECoG has been proposed as a potential control signal for
              implantable brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) in paralyzed
              patients. For the neuronal control of a prosthesis with versatile
              hand/arm functions, it is also necessary to successfully decode
              different types of grasping movements, such as precision grip and
              whole-hand grip. Although grasping is one of the most frequent
              and important hand movements performed in everyday life, until
              now, the decoding of ECoG activity related to different grasp
              types has not been systematically investigated. Here, we show
              that two different grasp types (precision vs. whole-hand grip)
              can be reliably distinguished in natural reach-to-grasp movements
              in single-trial ECoG recordings from the human motor cortex.
              Self-paced movement execution in a paradigm accounting for
              variability in grasped object position and weight was chosen to
              create a situation similar to everyday settings. We identified
              three informative signal components (low-pass-filtered component,
              low-frequency and high-frequency amplitude modulations), which
              allowed for accurate decoding of precision and whole-hand grips.
              Importantly, grasp type decoding generalized over different
              object positions and weights. Within the frontal lobe,
              informative signals predominated in the precentral motor cortex
              and could also be found in the right hemisphere's homologue of
              Broca's area. We conclude that ECoG signals are promising

              subdural 64-channel mini-ECoG grid over the hand area of the

              sensations were usually of artificial quality, but in some cases
              were more natural and of a cutaneous or proprioceptive nature.
              Increases in pulse width, current strength and frequency
              generally produced similar quality sensations at the same

  abstract = "The sensation of flutter is produced when mechanical vibrations
              in the range of 5-50Hz are applied to the skin. A flutter
              stimulus activates neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex
              (S1) that somatotopically map to the site of stimulation. A
              subset of these neurons-those with quickly adapting properties,
              associated with Meissner's corpuscles-are strongly entrained by
              periodic flutter vibrations, firing with a probability that
              oscillates at the input frequency. Hence, quickly adapting
              neurons provide a dynamic representation of such flutter stimuli.
              However, are these neurons directly involved in the perception of
              flutter? Here we investigate this in monkeys trained to
              discriminate the difference in frequency between two flutter
              stimuli delivered sequentially on the fingertips. Microelectrodes
              were inserted into area 3b of S1 and the second stimulus was
              substituted with a train of injected current pulses. Animals
              reliably indicated whether the frequency of the second
              (electrical) signal was higher or lower than that of the first
              (mechanical) signal, even though both frequencies changed from
              trial to trial. Almost identical results were obtained with
              periodic and aperiodic stimuli of equal average frequencies.
              Thus, the quickly adapting neurons in area 3b activate the
              circuit leading to the perception of flutter. Furthermore, as far
              as can be psychophysically quantified during discrimination, the
              neural code underlying the sensation of flutter can be finely
              manipulated, to the extent that the behavioural responses
              produced by natural and artificial stimuli are indistinguishable.",

              questions about which direction modern journalism should take as
              a whole. To test the feasibility of immersive storytelling, this
              study developed a cognitive experience model containing paths for
              presence, flow, credibility, empathy, understanding, and
              enjoyment. A total of 131 participants were divided into three
              groups and exposed to either VR, 360-degree videos, or
              two-dimensional (2D) videos, then asked to rate their
              experiences. With the exception of understanding, results showed
              that the VR and 360-degree videos were more highly evaluated in
              each path when compared with 2D videos. In this case, technical
              attributes did not greatly affect the study variables. However,
              presence played a vital role in news promotion, while flow was
              positively affected by presence; flow also affected other
              variables when combined with presence. Finally, a structural

               Recently, it has been suggested that stimulating the mastoid by
               vibration relieves cybersickness. This study aimed to verify
               this proposition.Subjects and Method Fifty-four young male
               adults (aged 18 to 27 years) without any experience of severe
               motion sickness or cybersickness participated in this study.
               Participants were divided in half into two groups, the
               experimental group and control group. The experimental group
               used VR with mastoid vibration, and the control group
               experienced VR without mastoid vibration. Participants responded
               to the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) to quantify
               cybersickness.Results The total severity scores of cybersickness
               in the experimental group ranged from 0 to 183.3 with the mean
               value of 46.7$\pm$49.0. The total severity scores of

              tool has been shown to induce motor and cognitive improvements in
              different populations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (fMRI) has been used to investigate neuroplasticity resulting
              from these treatments. We hypothesize that VR rehabilitation
              induces functional improvement and brain changes that can be
              detected by fMRI. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effects
              of VR intervention on the cortical reorganization measured by
              fMRI and associated with functional improvement. METHODS: We
              performed a systematic review of studies published between 2005
              and 2021. Papers were retrieved from six databases using the
              following keywords: ``motor rehabilitation'', ``fMRI'' and
              ``virtual reality''. Case studies, pre-post studies,
              cross-sectional studies, and randomized controlled trials
              published were included. Manuscripts were assessed by The NIH
              Study Quality Assessment Tools to determine their quality.
              RESULTS: Twenty-three articles met our eligibility criteria: 18
              about VR rehabilitation in stroke and five on other clinical
              conditions (older adults, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson's
              disease). Changes in neural patterns of activation and
              reorganization were revealed in both the ipsilesional and the
              contralesional hemispheres. Results were located mainly in the
              primary motor cortex, sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor
              area in post-stroke patients in the acute, subacute, and chronic
              rehabilitation phases, and were associated with functional
              improvement after VR intervention. Similar effects were observed
              in older adults and in patients with other neurological diseases
              with improved performance. CONCLUSION: Most stroke-related
              studies showed either restoration to normal or increase of
              activation patterns or relateralization at/to the ipsilesional
              hemisphere, with some also reporting a decrease in activity or
              extent of activation after VR therapy. In general, VR

              feeling of embodiment over an artificial body part seen from a
              first-person perspective. Although such feeling of ownership (FO)
              has been described in different situations, it is not yet

              track the real-time brain dynamics associated with FO, we

              an enhancement in the connectivity with the posterior parietal
              cortex which is related to the strength of ownership illusion
              ratings and thus likely reflects conscious feelings of
              embodiment. Our results suggest that changes of bodily
              representations are underpinned by a dynamic cross-talk within a
              highly-plastic, fronto-parietal network.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENTObserving an avatar's body part from a first-person
              perspective, induces an illusory embodiment over it. What remains
              unknown are the cortical dynamics underpinning the embodiment of
              artificial agents. To shed light on the physiological mechanisms
              of embodiment we used a novel approach that combines non-invasive
              stimulation of the cortical motor-hand area and whole-scalp
              electroencephalographic recordings in people observing an
              embodied artificial limb. We found that just before the illusion
              started, there is a decrease of activity of the motor-hand area
              accompanied by an increase of connectivity with the parietal
              region ipsilateral to the stimulation that reflects the ratings
              of the embodiment illusion. Our results suggest that changes of
              bodily representations are underpinned by a dynamic cross-talk
              within a fronto-parietal circuit.",

              effects of stimulus parameters are not fully understood. In this
              study, we systematically tested the impact of various stimulation
              parameters on the generation of motor symptoms and
              afterdischarges (ADs). Focal electrical stimulation was delivered
              at subdural cortical, intracortical, and hippocampal sites in a
              rat model. The effects of stimulus parameter on the generation of
              motor symptoms and on the occurrence of ADs were examined. The
              effect of stimulus irregularity was tested using random or
              regular 50Hz stimulation through subdural electrodes. Hippocampal
              stimulation produced ADs at lower thresholds than neocortical
              stimulation. Hippocampal stimulation also produced significantly
              longer ADs. Both in hippocampal and cortical stimulation, when
              the total current was kept constant with changing pulse width,
              the threshold for motor symptom or AD was lowest between 50 and
              100Hz and higher at both low and high frequencies. However, if
              the pulse width was fixed, the threshold did not increase above
              100Hz and it apparently continued to decrease through 800Hz even
              if the difference did not reach statistical significance. There
              was no significant difference between random and regular

              location and several stimulus parameters including frequency,

              abilities lost due to disease or injury - for instance, a deep
              brain stimulator (DBS) that allows a person with Parkinson's
              disease to regain the ability to fluently perform movements or a
              Brain Computer Interface (BCI) that enables a person with spinal
              cord injury to control a robotic arm. While users recognize and
              appreciate the technologies' capacity to maintain or restore
              their capabilities, the neuroethics literature is replete with
              examples of concerns expressed about agentive capacities: A
              perceived lack of control over the movement of a robotic arm
              might result in an altered sense of feeling responsible for that
              movement. Clinicians or researchers being able to record and
              access detailed information of a person's brain might raise
              privacy concerns. A disconnect between previous, current, and
              future understandings of the self might result in a sense of
              alienation. The ability to receive and interpret sensory feedback
              might change whether someone trusts the implanted device or
              themselves. Inquiries into the nature of these concerns and how
              to mitigate them has produced scholarship that often emphasizes
              one issue - responsibility, privacy, authenticity, or trust -
              selectively. However, we believe that examining these ethical
              dimensions separately fails to capture a key aspect of the
              experience of living with a neural device. In exploring their
              interrelations, we argue that their mutual significance for
              neuroethical research can be adequately captured if they are
              described under a unified heading of agency. On these grounds, we
              propose an ``Agency Map'' which brings together the diverse
              neuroethical dimensions and their interrelations into a
              comprehensive framework. With this, we offer a
              theoretically-grounded approach to understanding how these

               (2013) surveyed 70 therapy experts regarding interventions they
               predicted to increase in the next decade and virtual reality
               (VR) was ranked 4th out of 45 options, with other
               computer-supported methods occupying 4 out of the top 5
               positions. The increased popularity of VR in the news, social
               media, conferences, and from innovative start-ups may give the
               impression that VR is something new. However, it is important to
               look back in time and recognize that as early as the 1960's,
               Heilig proposed a multisensory immersive experienced called the
               Sensorama, and Sutherland and Sproull had created a stereoscopic
               head mounted display (HMD) (Berryman 2012; Srivastava et al.
               2014). The term VR was coined more than 30 years ago by Jaron
               Lanier and commercial games were distributed to the public as
               early as 1989 by Mattel (in the US, and by PAX in Japan) for its
               PowerGlove™ and Nintendo's failed Virtual Boy™ was released in
               1995. Clinical VR applications were proposed as early as the mid
               1990's by Lamson, Pugnetti, Rothbaum, Riva, Rizzo, Weiss, and
               Wiederhold (named in alphabetical order), among others.
               Moreover, several scientific journals, conferences, and

               combines this prediction with reports from the sensory system to
               form a belief.Considering the brain's control of movements, and
               variations despite biomechanical similarities among old and
               young, healthy and unhealthy, and humans and other animals,
               Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi review evidence suggesting that motor
               commands reflect an economic decision made by our brain weighing
               reward and effort. This evidence also suggests that the brain
               prefers to receive a reward sooner than later, devaluing or
               discounting reward with the passage of time; then as the value
               of the expected reward changes in the brain with the passing of
               time (because of development, disease, or evolution), the shape
               of our movements will also change.The internal models formed by
               the brain provide the brain with an essential survival skill:
               the ability to predict based on past observations. The formal
               concepts presented by Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi offer a way to
               describe how representations are formed, what structure they
               have, and how the theoretical concepts can be tested.",

              previous methods require human observer to give inputs explicitly
              (e.g., press buttons, voice interface), burdening the human in
              the loop of RL agent's learning process. Further, providing
              explicit human advise (feedback) continuously is not always
              possible or too restrictive, e.g., autonomous driving, disabled

              human's intrinsic reactions as implicit (and natural) feedback
              through EEG in the form of error-related potentials (ErrP),
              providing a natural and direct way for humans to improve the RL

              RL agent, improving the label efficiency and robustness to human
              mistakes, and (iii) compared to prior works, we scale the

              during movement from {ECoG} signals in non-human primate",
  author   = "Farrokhi, Behraz and Erfanian, Abbas",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In this study, we proposed a state-based probabilistic
              method for decoding hand positions during unilateral and
              bilateral movements using the ECoG signals recorded from the
              brain of Rhesus monkey. APPROACH: A customized electrode array
              was implanted subdurally in the right hemisphere of the brain
              covering from the primary motor cortex to the frontal cortex.
              Three different experimental paradigms were considered:
              ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral movements. During
              unilateral movement, the monkey was trained to get food with one
              hand, while during bilateral movement, the monkey used its left
              and right hands alternately to get food. To estimate the hand
              positions, a state-based probabilistic method was introduced
              which was based on the conditional probability of the hand
              movement state (i.e. idle, right hand movement, and left hand
              movement) and the conditional expectation of the hand position
              for each state. Moreover, a hybrid feature extraction method
              based on linear discriminant analysis and partial least squares
              (PLS) was introduced. MAIN RESULTS: The proposed method could
              successfully decode the hand positions during ipsilateral,
              contralateral, and bilateral movements and significantly improved
              the decoding performance compared to the conventional Kalman and
              PLS regression methods [Formula: see text]. The proposed hybrid
              feature extraction method was found to outperform both the PLS
              and PCA methods [Formula: see text]. Investigating the kinematic
              information of each frequency band shows that more informative
              frequency bands were [Formula: see text] (15-30 Hz) and [Formula:
              see text](50-100 Hz) for ipsilateral and [Formula: see text] and
              [Formula: see text] (100-200 Hz) for contralateral movements. It
              is observed that ipsilateral movement was decoded better than
              contralateral movement for [Formula: see text] (5-15 Hz) and
              [Formula: see text] bands, while contralateral movements was
              decoded better for [Formula: see text] (30-200 Hz) and hfECoG
              (200-400 Hz) bands. SIGNIFICANCE: Accurate decoding the bilateral
              movement using the ECoG recorded from one brain hemisphere is an
              important issue toward real-life applications of the
              brain-machine interface technologies.",

               BMIs describe devices driven by signals from the motor system,
               which includes regions both on the surface and in deeper
               portions of the brain. These devices can be used to restore or

               as to provide therapy for individuals with deficits in part of
               the motor circuit function. Implanted motor BMIs, particularly
               those based on electrocorticography (ECoG) and deep brain
               stimulation (DBS) technologies, are burgeoning as a result of
               advances in wireless, implanted technologies in humans, and are
               based on foundational advances developed in research

               Future advances will be based upon further hardware and

               between studies of learning in biological and artificial
               systems. Much early work that led to the development of
               reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for artificial systems
               was inspired by learning rules first developed in biology by
               Bush and Mosteller, and Rescorla and Wagner. More recently,
               temporal-difference RL, developed for learning in artificial
               agents, has provided a foundational framework for interpreting
               the activity of dopamine neurons. In this Review, we describe
               state-of-the-art work on RL in biological and artificial agents.
               We focus on points of contact between these disciplines and
               identify areas where future research can benefit from
               information flow between these fields. Most work in biological
               systems has focused on simple learning problems, often embedded
               in dynamic environments where flexibility and ongoing learning
               are important, similar to real-world learning problems faced by
               biological systems. In contrast, most work in artificial agents
               has focused on learning a single complex problem in a static
               environment. Moving forward, work in each field will benefit
               from a flow of ideas that represent the strengths within each
               discipline. Research on reinforcement learning in artificial
               agents focuses on a single complex problem within a static
               environment. In biological agents, research focuses on simple
               learning problems embedded in flexible, dynamic environments.

              obtained by inducing expectation of benefit following a
              treatment. The current study assessed the behavioural and brain
              activity correlates of a placebo procedure inducing an
              enhancement of non-noxious somatic sensation. An experimental
              group was verbally suggested and surreptitiously conditioned
              about the effect of an inert cream in enhancing tactile
              perception, while a control group was informed about the actual
              inefficacy of the cream. Both groups received non-noxious
              electric shocks activating A-Beta fibres on the right index
              finger, before and after application of the cream in the same
              site. The behavioural and neurophysiological effects of this
              procedure were measured by a numerical rating scale of subjective
              perception and by recording cortical and subcortical
              somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs). Although the intensity of
              stimulation was physically identical in the two sessions, the
              experimental group reported stronger tactile sensation after
              cream treatment than before. In parallel, the experimental group
              showed enhanced somatosensory cortical responses (N140, P200)
              after treatment, whereas subcortical and early-cortical SEP
              components did not change. We suggest that these findings reflect
              top-down modulation on tactile perception probably due to an
              interplay between expectation and attention and might rely on
              interactions between prefrontal and parietal brain regions.",

              extracorporeal devices, thereby bypassing the muscles and senses

              technique to preserve neurological functions, especially the
              language. It is still challenging to map the optic radiations due
              to the difficulty to test the visual field intraoperatively. To
              assess the visual field during awake craniotomy, we developed the
              Functions' Explorer based on a virtual reality headset (FEX-VRH).
              METHODS: The impaired visual field of 10 patients was tested with
              automated perimetry (the gold standard examination) and the
              FEX-VRH. The proof-of-concept test was done during the surgery
              performed on a patient who was blind in his right eye and
              presenting with a left parietotemporal glioblastoma. The FEX-VRH
              was used intraoperatively, simultaneously with direct subcortical
              electrostimulation, allowing identification and preservation of
              the optic radiations. RESULTS: The FEX-VRH detected 9 of the 10
              visual field defects found by automated perimetry. The patient
              who underwent an awake craniotomy with intraoperative mapping of
              the optic tract using the FEX-VRH had no permanent postoperative
              visual field defect. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative visual field
              assessment with the FEX-VRH during direct subcortical
              electrostimulation is a promising approach to mapping the optical
              radiations and preventing a permanent visual field defect during
              awake surgery for epilepsy or tumor.",

  abstract = "We experience objects as whole, complete entities irrespective of
              whether they are perceived by our sensory systems or are recalled

              properties of objects are encoded and processed in different
              areas of the brain. How then, do coherent representations emerge?
              One theory suggests that rhythmic synchronization of neural
              discharges in the gamma band (around 40 Hz) may provide the
              necessary spatial and temporal links that bind together the
              processing in different brain areas to build a coherent percept.
              In this article we propose that this mechanism could also be used
              more generally for the construction of object representations
              that are driven by sensory input or internal, top-down processes.
              The review will focus on the literature on gamma oscillatory
              activities in humans and will describe the different types of
              gamma responses and how to analyze them. Converging evidence that

              technologies that are of increasing interest to researchers. BCI
              has been proposed as assistive technology for individuals who are
              non-communicative or paralyzed, such as those with amyotrophic
              lateral sclerosis or spinal cord injury. The technology has also
              been suggested for enhancement and entertainment uses, and there
              are companies currently marketing BCI devices for those purposes
              (e.g., gaming) as well as health-related purposes (e.g.,
              communication). The unprecedented direct connection created by
              BCI between human brains and computer hardware raises various
              ethical, social, and legal challenges that merit further
              examination and discussion. METHODS: To identify and characterize
              the key issues associated with BCI use, we performed a scoping
              review of biomedical ethics literature, analyzing the ethics
              concerns cited across multiple disciplines, including philosophy
              and medicine. RESULTS: Based on this investigation, we report
              that BCI research and its potential translation to therapeutic
              intervention generate significant ethical, legal, and social
              concerns, notably with regards to personhood, stigma, autonomy,
              privacy, research ethics, safety, responsibility, and justice.
              Our review of the literature determined, furthermore, that while
              these issues have been enumerated extensively, few concrete
              recommendations have been expressed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude
              that future research should focus on remedying a lack of
              practical solutions to the ethical challenges of BCI, alongside
              the collection of empirical data on the perspectives of the
              public, BCI users, and BCI researchers.",

              periods: 0.1-0.9, 1.0-3.9, 4.0-6.9, 7.0-9.9, 10.0-12.9, and
              13.0-17.9 years. RESULTS: Of 2,125 participants without clinical
              AD dementia, 442 (21\%) developed clinical AD dementia over 18
              years of follow-up. Lower composite cognitive test scores were
              associated with the development of AD dementia over the duration
              of the study. The magnitude of association between composite
              cognitive test score and development of AD dementia increased
              from an odds ratio of 3.39 (95\% confidence interval 1.72, 6.67;
              p < 0.001) at 13.0-17.9 years to 9.84 (95\% confidence interval

              tests of episodic memory, executive function, and global

              BCI control based on the voluntary modulation of sensorimotor
              rhythms (SMR) report that BCI control could not be achieved by a
              non-negligible number of subjects (estimated 20\% to 25\%). This
              failure of the BCI system to read the intention of the user is
              one of the greatest problems and challenges in BCI research.
              There are two main causes for this problem in SMR-based BCI
              systems: either no idle SMR is observed over motor areas of the
              user, or this idle rhythm is not modulated during motor imagery,
              resulting in a classification performance lower than 70\%
              (criterion level) that renders the control of a BCI application

                  (ICBM152) Stereotaxic Registration Model This is a version of
                  the ICBM Average Brain - an average of 152 T1-weighted MRI
                  scans, linearly transformed to Talairach space - that is
                  specially adapted for use with the MNI Linear Registration
                  Package (mni\_autoreg). Methods In 2001, within the ICBM
                  project (Mazziotta et al., 1995, 2001a,b), three sites (MNI,
                  UCLA, UTHSCSA) each collected ~150 MRI volume images from a
                  normative young adult population. These images were acquired
                  at a higher resolution than the MNI305 data and exhibited
                  improved contrast. To create MNI152, each individual in the
                  MNI cohort was linearly registered to MNI305. This new
                  template exhibits better contrast and better definition of
                  the top of the brain and the bottom of the cerebellum due to
                  the increased cover- age during acquisition. Publications

                  2009 A number of unbiased non-linear averages of the MNI152
                  database have been generated that combines the attractions of
                  both high-spatial resolution and signal-to-noise while not
                  being subject to the vagaries of any single brain (Fonov et
                  al., 2011). The procedure involved multiple iterations of a
                  process where, at each iteration, individual native MRIs were
                  non-linearly fitted to the average template from the previous
                  iteration, beginning with the MNI152 linear template. We
                  present an unbiased standard magnetic resonance imaging
                  template brain volume for normal population. These volumes
                  were created using data from ICBM project. Viewing Viewing
                  the multiple atlas volumes online requires Java browser
                  support. The Java Internet Viewer (JIV2) used here is
                  available for download and personal use under the GNU general
                  public license (GPL). To view the ICBM 2009 atlases online
                  Click ``View with JIV'' links below. The MNI stereotaxic
                  coordinates (X,Y,Z) are displayed in the first row below the
                  volumes. For viewing, one can use the left most mouse button
                  to click on any image, and the other cross-sectional images
                  will be updated with the appropriate position. You can also
                  hold the middle/rocker mouse button down while moving up or
                  down, to pan through the image plane. Holding `Shift' with
                  the left or middle button will enable dragging and zooming.
                  When looking at the images, remember that left is left and
                  right is right! Methods Image pre-processing included
                  non-uniform intensity correction (Sled, 1998) and intensity
                  normalization to a range of 0--100. All T1w MRI data was then
                  transformed into the Talairach-like MNI stereotaxic space
                  using minctracc (Collins, Neelin et al. 1994). Brain masking
                  was performed using BET (Smith, 2002). Age-based subgroups of
                  subjects were created, and all scans within each group were
                  then automatically re-registered to the stereotaxic space
                  using the appropriate template. For each group, an iterative
                  nonlinear co-registration algorithm (Grabner, Janke et al.
                  2006, Fonov, 2011), was applied to obtain the group averages.
                  The T1-based transformation was then applied to the T2, PD
                  and tissue classified volumes to generate average atlases for
                  these data. Methodological details can be found in (Fonov,
                  2011). Anatomical Structures Segmentation All necessary files

                  Vladimir Fonov MNI-Colin27 (N=27 average of unique
                  participant: high SNR data) Colin 27 Average Brain,
                  Stereotaxic Registration Model, original 1998 version This is
                  a stereotaxic average of 27 T1-weighted MRI scans of the same
                  individual. In 1998, a new atlas with much higher definition
                  than MNI305s was created at the MNI. One individual (CJH) was
                  scanned 27 times and the images linearly registered to create
                  an average with high SNR and structure definition (Holmes et
                  al., 1998). This average was linearly registered to the
                  average 305. Ironically, this dataset was not originally
                  intended for use as a stereotaxic template but as the sub-
                  strate for an ROI parcellation scheme to be used with ANIMAL
                  non-linear spatial normalization (Collins et al., 1995), i.e.
                  it was intended for the purpose of segmentation, NOT
                  stereotaxy. As a single brain atlas, it did not capture
                  anatomical variability and was, to some degree, a reversion
                  to the Talairach approach. However, the high definition
                  proved too attractive to the community and, after non-linear
                  mapping to fit the MNI305 space, it has been adopted by many
                  groups as a stereotaxic template (e.g., AFNI, Cox,;
                  Brainstorm, Tadel et al., 2011; SPM, Litvak et al., 2011;
                  Fieldtrip, Oostenveld et al., 2011). Methods This average
                  dataset was created in a two step process. First, each of the
                  27 T1-weighted scans were registered to stereotaxic space
                  using the mritotal procedure and resampled onto a 1mm grid in
                  stereotaxic space. All 27 scans were averaged together to
                  create an initial average. This average volume was used as a
                  target for the second phase of registration where each
                  original T1-weighted MRI was re-registered in stereotaxic
                  space. This procedure has the advantage of removing the small
                  variance in intra-subject mapping in stereotaxic space
                  associated with the use of a multi-subject average.

                  MNI Average Brain (an average of 305 T1-weighted MRI scans,
                  linearly transformed to Talairach space) specially adapted
                  for use with the MNI Linear Registration Package (mni\_reg).
                  Methods In order to overcome the idiosyncrasies of using a
                  single subject brain as a template, in the early 1990s Evans
                  and colleagues introduced the concept of a statistical MRI
                  atlas for brain mapping (Evans et al., 1992a,b, 1993). The
                  MNI305 atlas was constructed in two steps. First, anatomical
                  landmarks were manually identified in T1-weighted MRI scans
                  from young healthy subjects. These landmarks were chosen from
                  the Talairach and Tournoux atlas and thus the final aver- age
                  and space approximated Talairach space. Landmarks from each
                  subject were fitted together via least-squares linear
                  regression that matched the resulting AC-PC line to the
                  original Talairach and Tournoux atlas. This yielded a
                  first-pass average T1-weighted MRI volume. Second, each
                  native MRI volume was automatically mapped to the
                  manually-derived average MRI to reduce the impact of order
                  effects, manual errors and to create a sharper average. The
                  mapping was not performed according to Talairach's piecewise
                  linear model but used a whole-brain linear (9-parameter)
                  image similarity residual (Collins et al., 1994). The
                  resultant template is thus an approx- imation of the original
                  Talairach space and the Z-coordinate is approximately +3.5 mm
                  relative to the Talairach coordinate. This process resulted
                  in the original MNI305 atlas that has sub- sequently defined
                  the MNI space. Note that, under constraints of linear
                  alignment, residual non-linear anatomical variability across
                  subjects gives rise to a ``virtual convolution'' (Evans et
                  al., 1993) that somewhat enlarges the template compared with
                  most individual brains. Publications Collins, D.L., Neelin,

  abstract = "Depression diagnosis is a challenging clinical task currently
              conducted mostly using subjective criteria. It is well known that
              depression alters the neural activity in the brain, so that the
              corresponding neurophysiological signature may be measured using
              non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals. These, in
              turn, may be possible to decode using machine learning
              algorithms. Despite the extensive literature, the existing
              techniques rely on several channels and obtrusive systems. In
              this paper, and for the first time, the diagnostic power of each
              EEG channel for depression detection is analyzed using
              Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA). Our results indicate that
              a mere two features collected from one EEG channel suffice for
              reliable diagnosis. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
              method, a dataset comprising seven minutes of EEG recording from
              84 subjects is used. The data was divided into two separate sets,
              one for feature selection and one for diagnostic classification.
              We delineate brain regions that have the strongest discriminative
              power linked to depression diagnosis. Thus, we identified one
              electrode (i.e., AF4) located on the frontal lobe, which can be
              used to diagnose depression with high accuracy. After evaluation
              of a series of shallow machine learning methods, we achieved the
              classification accuracy of 80.8\%, sensitivity of 60\% and
              specificity of 99.7\% with two features from one electrode. We
              also achieved the highest classification accuracy of 91.8\%, the
              specificity of 93.5\%, and sensitivity of 90\% with two
              electrodes and three features. Our findings show that it is
              possible to significantly reduce the complexity of algorithms to
              diagnose depression with the motivation of use in highly
              accessible wearable devices.",

              focuses on the phantom sensations, especially pain, that seem to

              role of the body image in maintaining the sense of the phantom. A
              minority of work in the field distinguishes the body image from
              body schema, and offers an important corrective to the literature

              developed and what additional functions, through continued
              evolution, it has co-opted. Consider episodic memory. If we
              believe that episodic memory evolved solely to accurately
              represent past events, it seems like a terrible system-prone to
              forgetting and false memories. However, if we believe that
              episodic memory developed to flexibly and creatively combine and
              rearrange memories of prior events in order to plan for the
              future, then it is quite a good system. We argue that
              consciousness originally developed as part of the episodic memory
              system-quite likely the part needed to accomplish that flexible
              recombining of information. We posit further that consciousness
              was subsequently co-opted to produce other functions that are not
              directly relevant to memory per se, such as problem-solving,
              abstract thinking, and language. We suggest that this theory is
              compatible with many phenomena, such as the slow speed and the
              after-the-fact order of consciousness, that cannot be explained
              well by other theories. We believe that our theory may have
              profound implications for understanding intentional action and
              consciousness in general. Moreover, we suggest that episodic
              memory and its associated memory systems of sensory, working, and
              semantic memory as a whole ought to be considered together as the
              conscious memory system in that they, together, give rise to the
              phenomenon of consciousness. Lastly, we suggest that the cerebral
              cortex is the part of the brain that makes consciousness
              possible, and that every cortical region contributes to this
              conscious memory system.",

              inevitable occurrence in everyday life. Yet we generally have a
              strong experience that occluded objects continue to exist,
              despite the fact that they objectively disappear. This indicates
              that neural object representations must be maintained during
              dynamic occlusion. However, it is unclear what the nature of such
              representation is and in particular whether it is perception-like
              or more abstract, for example, reflecting limited features such
              as position or movement direction only. In this study, we address
              this question by examining how different object features such as
              object shape, luminance, and position are represented in the
              brain when a moving object is dynamically occluded. We apply
              multivariate decoding methods to Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
              data to track how object representations unfold over time. Our
              methods allow us to contrast the representations of multiple
              object features during occlusion and enable us to compare the
              neural responses evoked by visible and occluded objects. The
              results show that object position information is represented
              during occlusion to a limited extent while object identity
              features are not maintained through the period of occlusion.
              Together, this suggests that the nature of object representations
              during dynamic occlusion is different from visual representations

               but are rather predictable due to the temporal regularity in
               that they occur. Besides sensory-related cortical areas, the
               cerebellum has been suggested as a key structure in temporal
               processing and in the anticipation of future events. Hence,
               patients with cerebellum lesions show impaired precision in
               temporal processing as reflected in the reduced ability to
               exploit temporal regularity. Using transcranial direct current
               stimulation (tDCS), we here aimed to draw further causal
               conclusions on the human cerebellum as functionally relevant in
               temporal processing of acoustic events. We focused on the
               electrophysiologic P3b, a large positive wave apparent in the
               electroencephalography (EEG), that represents encoding of
               task-relevant events and that has been demonstrated as sensitive
               to the exploitation of temporal regularities. Participants
               received 30 min of anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS over the
               cerebellum while they performed two oddball paradigms with
               different temporal regularities in that the acoustic stimuli
               were presented. Following clinical observations, we hypothesized
               that tDCS-effects will be present in the regular oddball
               paradigm only, thus, in the condition that allows anticipating
               the occurrence of subsequent stimuli. In result, we found that
               cathodal tDCS over the cerebellum reduced the P3b-amplitude
               specifically in response to target stimuli in the regular
               paradigm. Thereby, tDCS-induced changes mirror the effects of
               cerebellar lesions in clinical samples. Our data provides direct
               evidence for a causal link between the human cerebellum and
               auditory processing of temporal regularity and emphasize future
               work on a potential benefit of cerebellar-tDCS in clinical

               hampers the detection of the earliest phases of the disease-the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows
              steering the stimulation in an axial direction which offers
              greater flexibility in programming. However, accurate anatomical
              visualization of the lead orientation is required for
              interpreting the observed stimulation effects and to guide
              programming. OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to develop and
              test an accurate and robust algorithm for determining the
              orientation of segmented electrodes based on standard
              postoperative CT imaging used in DBS. METHODS: Orientation angles
              of directional leads (CartesiaTM; Boston Scientific, Marlborough,
              MA, USA) were determined using CT imaging. Therefore, a
              sequential algorithm was developed that quantitatively compares
              the similarity of the observed CT artifacts with calculated
              artifact patterns based on the lead's orientation marker and a
              geometric model of the segmented electrodes. Measurements of
              seven ground truth phantoms and three leads with 60 different
              configurations of lead implantation and orientation angles were
              analyzed for validation. RESULTS: The accuracy of the determined
              electrode orientation angles was -0.6 $\pm$ 1.5° (range: -5.4 to
              4.2°). This accuracy proved to be sufficiently high to resolve
              even subtle differences between individual leads. CONCLUSIONS:
              The presented algorithm is user independent and provides highly
              accurate results for the orientation of the segmented electrodes
              for all angular constellations that typically occur in clinical

              concerted effort to integrate neuroethics into its science. In
              the past five years, the BRAIN Initiative has given rise to
              powerful tools and neurotechnologies capable of probing deeply
              into the brain circuits in animal models. As these tools mature
              and move to human applications they will raise a host of
              important neuroethical considerations not just for the medical

              to assess the status and consider the future of the BRAIN

               behavior. Despite this long history, it is still unclear how the
               activity of neural populations is affected by stimulation. For
               example, there is still no consensus on where activated cells
               lie or on the extent to which neural processes such as passing
               axons near the electrode are also activated. Past studies of
               this question have proven difficult because microstimulation
               interferes with electrophysiological recordings, which in any
               case provide only coarse information about the location of
               activated cells. We used two-photon calcium imaging, an optical
               method, to circumvent these hurdles. We found that

               become a classic text in biomedical ethics. Major structural
               changes mark the revision. The authors have added a new
               concluding chapter on methods that, along with its companion
               chapter on moral theory, emphasizes convergence across theories,
               coherence in moral justification, and the common morality. They
               have simplified the opening chapter on moral norms which
               introduces the framework of prima facie moral principles and
               ways to specify and balance them. Together with the shift of
               advanced material on theory to the back of the book, this
               heavily revised introductory chapter will make it easier for the
               wide range of students entering bioethics courses to use this
               text. Another important change is the increased emphasis on
               character and moral agency, drawing the distinction between
               agents and actions. The sections on truth telling, disclosure of
               bad news, privacy, conflicts of interest, and research on human
               subjects have also been throughly reworked. The four core
               chapters on principles (respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence,
               beneficence, and justice) and the chapter on
               professional-patient relationships retain their familiar

              the presynaptic neuronal elements activated by electrical
              stimulation have never been clearly identified: it could be the
              excitable dendrites, the cell body, the axon initial segment, or
              the axonal branches. To identify these elements, we performed two
              series of experiments on slices of rat visual cortex maintained
              in vitro. The first series of experiments, reported in this
              paper, was aimed at determining the chronaxie, a temporal
              parameter related to the membrane properties of the neuronal
              elements. In order to identify the presynaptic elements that were
              activated by extracellular electrical stimulation, chronaxies
              corresponding to postsynaptic responses were measured and
              compared with those corresponding to the activation of axons
              (antidromic activation) and those corresponding to the activation
              of cell bodies (intracellular current injection in
              intracellularly recorded neurons). The chronaxie for orthodromic
              activation was similar to that for axonal activation, but was 40
              times smaller than the chronaxie for direct cell body activation.
              This suggests that, whenever a postsynaptic response is elicited
              after electrical stimulation of the cortical gray matter, axons
              (either axonal branches or axon initial segments), but not cell

              at a current below the threshold for afterdischarge evoked
              repeated statistically significant errors in object naming. The
              language center was highly localized in many patients to form
              several mosaics of 1 to 2 sq cm, usually one in the frontal and
              one or more in the temporoparietal lobe. The area of individual
              mosaics, and the total area related to language was usually much
              smaller than the traditional Broca-Wernicke areas. There was
              substantial individual variability in the exact location of
              language function, some of which correlated with the patient's
              sex and verbal intelligence. These features were present for
              patients as young as 4 years and as old as 80 years, and for

               suggests--provides an overview of the principles of psychology.
               Written at a time when psychology was a ``youthful'' science and
               the debate over the field's status as a natural science (or even
               as a science at all) was relatively fresh, Principles of
               Psychology represents a stock-taking of sorts--a survey of the
               ends achieved and the newer trends of development in
               psychological research. The author's aim is to present and study
               psychological phenomena as actual, observable events consisting
               of the responses of psychological organisms on the one hand, and
               the stimulus objects or conditions which interact with them on
               the other. By dispensing with animatistic conceptions and
               intangible psychic phenomena that previously dominated the
               field, the author hopes to bolster psychology's position as a
               member of the family of natural sciences. According to the
               author, only by avoiding meticulously all powers or
               functions--whether considered as psychic or biological--which do
               not represent actual observable phenomena or interpretations
               derived from such observations, can psychology as a science be
               erected upon a firm foundation. It is to this end that the
               author presents 15 chapters on a wide range of topics that
               represent the core concepts and principles of psychology: The
               Domain, Method, and Development of Psychology; The Primary Data
               of Psychology; The Psychological Individual or Personality; The
               Psychological Organism or Personality in Action; The Simpler or
               Foundation Behavior Segments; The Nature of Basic Conduct and
               How it is Developed; The Development and Operation of Complex
               Human or Societal Conduct; Attention Behavior as the
               Actualization of Stimuli; The Nature of Sensing and Perceiving;
               Implicit Action as Responses to Absent Stimuli Objects;
               Association as a Fundamental Type of Psychological Activity; The

               Currently no good method for tracking in vivo neuronal
               connectivity exists. We investigated the inter-areal connections
               in vivo in the human language system using a new method, which
               we termed 'cortico-cortical evoked potentials' (CCEPs). Eight
               patients with epilepsy (age 13-42 years) underwent invasive
               monitoring with subdural electrodes for epilepsy surgery. Six
               patients had language dominance on the side of grid implantation
               and two had bilateral language representation by the
               intracarotid amobarbital test. Conventional cortical electrical
               stimulation was performed to identify the anterior and posterior
               language areas. Single pulse electrical stimuli were delivered
               to the anterior language (eight patients), posterior language
               (four patients) or face motor (two patients) area, and CCEPs
               were obtained by averaging electrocorticograms (ECoGs) recorded
               from the perisylvian and extrasylvian basal temporal language
               areas time-locked to the stimulus. The subjects were not asked
               to perform any tasks during the study. Stimulation at the
               anterior language area elicited CCEPs in the lateral
               temporo-parietal area (seven of eight patients) in the middle
               and posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus, the adjacent
               part of the middle temporal gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus.
               CCEPs were recorded in 3-21 electrodes per patient. CCEPs
               occurred at or around the particular electrodes in the posterior
               language area which, when stimulated, produced speech arrest.
               Similar early and late CCEPs were obtained from the basal
               temporal area by stimulating the anterior language area (three
               of three patients). In contrast, stimulation of the adjacent
               face motor area did not elicit CCEPs in language areas but
               rather in the postcentral gyrus. Stimulation of the posterior
               language area produced CCEPs in the anterior language (three of
               four patients) as well as in the basal temporal area (one of two
               patients). These CCEPs were less well defined. These findings
               suggest that perisylvian and extrasylvian language areas
               participate in the language system as components of a network by

  abstract  = "In order to understand the complex functional organization of
               the motor system, it is essential to know the anatomical and
               functional connectivity among individual motor areas.
               Clinically, knowledge of these cortico-cortical connections is
               important to understand the rapid spread of epileptic discharges
               through the network underlying ictal motor manifestation. In
               humans, however, knowledge of neuronal in vivo connectivity has
               been limited. We recently reported a new method,
               'cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP)', to electrically
               track the cortico-cortical connections by stimulating a part of
               the brain through subdural electrodes and recording the cortical
               evoked potentials that emanate from a distant region of the
               cortex via neuronal projections. We applied the CCEP methodology
               to investigate in vivo cortico-cortical connections between the
               lateral motor cortex [LMCx; sensorimotor (SM) and lateral
               premotor areas] and the medial motor cortex [MMCx; supplementary
               motor area proper (SMA), pre-SMA and foot SM]. Seven patients
               with intractable partial epilepsy were studied. These patients
               had chronic implantation of subdural electrodes covering part of
               the lateral and medial frontal areas. As a part of the routine
               pre-surgical evaluation, comprehensive cortical mapping was
               performed by electrical stimulation of the subdural electrodes,
               and the precise localization of the subdural electrodes was
               defined by MRI co-registration. Single-pulse electrical stimuli
               were delivered to MMCx (7 patients) and LMCx (4), and CCEPs
               time-locked to the stimuli were recorded by averaging
               electrocorticograms from LMCx and MMCx, respectively.
               Short-latency CCEPs were observed when stimulating MMCx and
               recording from LMCx (mean latency: 21.6 ms, range: 9-47 ms) and
               vice versa when stimulating LMCx and recording from MMCx (mean
               latency: 29.4 ms, range: 11-57 ms). In terms of the location of
               these stimulus sites and CCEP responses along the rostrocaudal
               axis, regression analysis revealed a consistent correlation
               between the sites of stimulation and maximum CCEP for
               stimulation of both MMCx and LMCx. Functionally, stimulation of
               the positive motor areas in MMCx elicited CCEPs at the
               somatotopically homologous regions in LMCx (71\%). The same
               findings were observed in MMCx (82\%) upon stimulation of LMCx.
               In four subjects in whom bi-directional connectivity was
               investigated by stimulating both MMCx and LMCx, reciprocality
               was observed in the majority of connections (78-94\%). In
               conclusion, the present study demonstrated a human motor
               cortico-cortical network connecting (i) anatomically homologous
               areas of LMCx and MMCx along the rostrocaudal cognitive-motor
               gradient; and (ii) somatotopically homologous regions in LMCx

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Source localization of cerebral activity using
              electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) can
              reveal noninvasively the generators of the abnormal signals
              recorded in epilepsy, such as interictal epileptic discharges
              (IEDs) and seizures. Here, we review recent progress showcasing
              the usefulness of these techniques in treating patients with
              drug-resistant epilepsy. RECENT FINDINGS: The source localization
              of IEDs by high-density EEG and MEG has now been proved in large
              patient cohorts to be accurate and clinically relevant, with
              positive and negative predictive values rivaling those of
              structural MRI. Localizing seizure onsets is an emerging
              technique that seems to perform similarly well to the
              localization of interictal spikes, although there remain
              questions regarding the processing of signals for reliable
              results. The localization of somatosensory cortex using EEG/MEG
              is well established. The localization of language cortex is less
              reliable, although progress has been made regarding hemispheric
              lateralization. Source localization is also able to reveal how
              epilepsy alters the dynamics of neuronal activity in the
              large-scale networks that underlie cerebral function. SUMMARY:
              Given the high performance of EEG/MEG source localization, these
              tools should find a place similar to that of established
              techniques like MRI in the assessment of patients for epilepsy

               motor-impaired individuals. A robotic arm can be controlled
               based on models that relate motor-cortical ensemble activity to
               kinematic parameters. The models are typically built and
               validated on data from structured trial periods during which a
               subject actively performs specific movements, but real-world
               prosthetic devices will need to operate correctly during rest
               periods as well. To develop a model of motor cortical modulation
               during rest, we trained monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to perform a
               reaching task with their own arm while recording motor-cortical
               single-unit activity. When a monkey spontaneously put its arm
               down to rest between trials, our traditional movement decoder
               produced a nonzero velocity prediction, which would cause
               undesired motion when applied to a prosthetic arm. During these
               rest periods, a marked shift was found in individual units'
               tuning functions. The activity pattern of the whole population
               during rest (Idle state) was highly distinct from that during
               reaching movements (Active state), allowing us to predict arm
               resting from instantaneous firing rates with 98\% accuracy using
               a simple classifier. By cascading this state classifier and the
               movement decoder, we were able to predict zero velocity
               correctly, which would avoid undesired motion in a prosthetic
               application. Interestingly, firing rates during hold periods
               followed the Active pattern even though hold kinematics were
               similar to those during rest with near-zero velocity. These
               findings expand our concept of motor-cortical function by
               showing that population activity reflects behavioral context in
               addition to the direct parameters of the movement itself.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Paralysis or amputation of an arm results in the
               loss of the ability to orient the hand and grasp, manipulate,
               and carry objects, functions that are essential for activities
               of daily living. Brain-machine interfaces could provide a
               solution to restoring many of these lost functions. We therefore
               tested whether an individual with tetraplegia could rapidly
               achieve neurological control of a high-performance prosthetic
               limb using this type of an interface. METHODS: We implanted two
               96-channel intracortical microelectrodes in the motor cortex of
               a 52-year-old individual with tetraplegia.
               Brain-machine-interface training was done for 13 weeks with the
               goal of controlling an anthropomorphic prosthetic limb with
               seven degrees of freedom (three-dimensional translation,
               three-dimensional orientation, one-dimensional grasping). The
               participant's ability to control the prosthetic limb was
               assessed with clinical measures of upper limb function. This
               study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01364480.
               FINDINGS: The participant was able to move the prosthetic limb
               freely in the three-dimensional workspace on the second day of
               training. After 13 weeks, robust seven-dimensional movements
               were performed routinely. Mean success rate on target-based
               reaching tasks was 91·6\% (SD 4·4) versus median chance level
               6·2\% (95\% CI 2·0-15·3). Improvements were seen in completion
               time (decreased from a mean of 148 s [SD 60] to 112 s [6]) and
               path efficiency (increased from 0·30 [0·04] to 0·38 [0·02]). The
               participant was also able to use the prosthetic limb to do
               skilful and coordinated reach and grasp movements that resulted
               in clinically significant gains in tests of upper limb function.
               No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: With continued
               development of neuroprosthetic limbs, individuals with long-term
               paralysis could recover the natural and intuitive command

  abstract  = "Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is becoming more prevalent
               as a planning tool for surgical treatment of intractable
               epilepsy. Stereoelectroencephalography uses long, thin,
               cylindrical ``depth'' electrodes containing multiple recording
               contacts along each electrode's length. Each lead is inserted
               into the brain percutaneously. The advantage of SEEG is that the
               electrodes can easily target deeper brain structures that are
               inaccessible with subdural grid electrodes, and SEEG does not
               require a craniotomy. Brain-machine interface (BMI) research is
               also becoming more common in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit. A
               brain-machine interface decodes a person's desired movement or
               action from the recorded brain activity and then uses the
               decoded brain activity to control an assistive device in real
               time. Although BMIs are primarily being developed for use by
               severely paralyzed individuals, epilepsy patients undergoing
               invasive brain monitoring provide an opportunity to test the
               effectiveness of different invasive recording electrodes for use
               in BMI systems. This study investigated the ability to use SEEG
               electrodes for control of 2D cursor velocity in a BMI. Two
               patients who were undergoing SEEG for intractable epilepsy
               participated in this study. Participants were instructed to
               wiggle or rest the hand contralateral to their SEEG electrodes
               to control the horizontal velocity of a cursor on a screen.
               Simultaneously they were instructed to wiggle or rest their feet
               to control the vertical component of cursor velocity. The BMI
               system was designed to detect power spectral changes associated
               with hand and foot activity and translate those spectral changes
               into horizontal and vertical cursor movements in real time.
               During testing, participants used their decoded SEEG signals to
               move the brain-controlled cursor to radial targets that appeared
               on the screen. Although power spectral information from 28 to 32
               electrode contacts were used for cursor control during the
               experiment, post hoc analysis indicated that better control may
               have been possible using only a single SEEG depth electrode
               containing multiple recording contacts in both hand and foot
               cortical areas. These results suggest that the advantages of
               using SEEG for epilepsy monitoring may also apply to using SEEG
               electrodes in BMI systems. Specifically, SEEG electrodes can
               target deeper brain structures, such as foot motor cortex, and
               both hand and foot areas can be targeted with a single SEEG
               electrode implanted percutaneously. Therefore, SEEG electrodes
               may be an attractive option for simple BMI systems that use
               power spectral modulation in hand and foot cortex for
               independent control of 2 degrees of freedom.",

               study investigated the effects of priming iTBS (ie, applying
               continuous theta burst stimulation before iTBS) on poststroke
               hemiparetic upper limb recovery. METHODS: In this randomized
               controlled trial, 42 patients with chronic stroke were recruited
               and randomly allocated to 10 sessions of either priming iTBS,
               nonpriming iTBS, or sham stimulation to the ipsilesional motor
               cortex, immediately before robot-assisted training. Outcomes
               included Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity, Action Research
               Arm Test and mean movement velocity during each robot-assisted
               training session. Twenty-one patients were enrolled for
               measuring the sensorimotor beta event-related desynchronization
               induced by either mirror visual feedback or movement. RESULTS:
               The Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores revealed a
               significant time-by-group interaction (P=0.011). Priming and
               nonpriming iTBS were both superior to sham stimulation in post
               hoc comparisons; however, the superiority was diminished at
               follow-up. Among patients with a higher functioning upper limb,
               priming iTBS yielded a significantly greater improvement in
               Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores than nonpriming
               iTBS (P=0.025) and sham stimulation (P=0.029) did. No
               significant interaction was found when analyzing the Action
               Research Arm Test and mean movement velocity. Priming iTBS
               enhanced the patients' mirror visual feedback-induced high beta
               sensorimotor event-related desynchronization over their
               ipsilesional hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Priming and nonpriming
               iTBS are both superior to sham stimulation in enhancing
               treatment gains from robot-assisted training, and patients with
               a higher functioning upper limb may experience more benefits
               from priming iTBS. Priming iTBS may facilitate poststroke motor
               learning by enhancing the permissiveness of the ipsilesional
               sensorimotor area to therapeutic sensory modalities, such as the
               mirror visual feedback. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.

               study utilizing the National Parkinson Foundation Quality
               Improvement Initiative clinical study was conducted. A group of
               275 patients who had undergone DBS for Parkinson's disease were
               extracted from 2916 subjects who were included in this data
               base. The data were compared to an age, sex, and disease
               severity matched control group. A secondary analysis was then
               performed on two more control groups that were matched to
               account for presence or absence of motor fluctuations. The
               multidimensional caregiver strain index and Parkinson's disease
               quality-of-life questionnaire 39 summary index were compared.
               RESULTS: The multidimensional caregiver strain index did not
               differ between the DBS group (16.9 $\pm$ 11.8) and a matched
               non-DBS group (16.1 $\pm$ 17.6, p = 0.618). The quality-of-life
               index was, however, significantly better in the DBS group (28.9
               $\pm$ 15.6) than in the non-DBS group (32.3 $\pm$ 17.6, p =
               0.034). A secondary analysis revealed that the total caregiver
               strain score was lower in the no motor fluctuation control group
               than the other two groups (p < 0.05). Regression analysis
               revealed significant relationships between the quality-of-life
               index and caregiver strain index total scores (p < 0.001),
               between caregiver strain index total score and age at surgery (p
               = 0.027), and also between the interval since surgery (p =
               0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Although there were several limitations to
               this study, DBS seems to improve quality of life without
               significantly increasing caregiver burden.",

               a sequential display of electrical stimulation as a function of
               each electrode, a precursor to today's electrodogram and
               interleaved stimulation. 2) Chouard performed total cochlear

               independent electrodes that were evenly distributed along the
               cochlea. 3) Chouard and MacLeod described in a patent detailed

               humans and presumably enables our most refined sensory and
               cognitive abilities. The links of this network form a
               fundamental aspect of its organization, and a great deal of
               research is focusing on understanding how information flows
               within and between different regions. However, an
               often-overlooked element of this connectivity regards a causal,
               hierarchical structure of regions, whereby certain nodes of the
               cortical network may exert greater influence over the others.
               While this is difficult to ascertain non-invasively, patients
               undergoing invasive electrode monitoring for epilepsy provide a
               unique window into this aspect of cortical organization. In this
               review, we highlight the potential for cortico-cortical evoked
               potential (CCEP) mapping to directly measure neuronal
               propagation across large-scale brain networks with

               asked which cortical regions can exert the greatest influence
               over other regions and the cortical network as a whole. Previous
               research on this question has relied on coarse anatomy (mapping
               large fiber pathways) or functional connectivity (mapping
               inter-regional statistical dependencies in ongoing activity).
               Here we combined direct electrical stimulation with recordings
               from the cortical surface to provide a novel insight into
               directed, inter-regional influence within the cerebral cortex of
               awake humans. These networks of directed interaction were
               reproducible across strength thresholds and across subjects.
               Directed network properties included (1) a decrease in the
               reciprocity of connections with distance; (2) major projector
               nodes (sources of influence) were found in peri-Rolandic cortex

               (DBS) of patients with PD allows reduction of antiparkinsonian
               medication but has only a mild direct effect on dyskinesia.
               Since antiparkinsonian medication has short- and long-term
               effects that may prevent an estimate of the maximal possible
               impact of STN DBS, such medication was used at the lowest
               possible dosage after DBS implantation. OBJECTIVE: To study the
               maximal and long-term effects of STN DBS using the lowest dose
               of medication. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with PD with
               motor fluctuations and dyskinesia underwent bilateral
               implantation under stereotactic guidance, microrecording, and
               clinical control. All medications were stopped before
               implantation and reintroduced, at the lowest dosage needed, only
               if the postoperative motor score did not reach the baseline
               level. Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor (subscale III)
               scores were measured at baseline and after 3, 6, 12, and 24
               months. RESULTS: After 21 plus minus 8 months, the UPDRS III
               ``off-medication'' score was decreased by 45\% and was similar
               to the preoperative UPDRS III ``on'' score. Overall, medication
               was reduced by 79\%, being completely withdrawn in 10 patients.
               Fluctuations and dyskinesia showed an overall reduction of
               >90\%, disappearing completely in patients without medication.
               These improvements were maintained for 2 years. CONCLUSIONS:
               These results show that STN DBS could replace levodopa and
               allowed all antiparkinsonian medication to be discontinued in
               50\% of patients with PD. Fluctuations and dyskinesia
               disappeared completely in these patients but persisted in those

               classification methods to identify tremors experienced by
               Parkinsonian patients. Some previous research has focussed
               tremor analysis on external body signals (e.g.,
               electromyography, accelerometer signals, etc.). Our advantage is
               that we have access to sub-cortical data, which facilitates the
               applicability of the obtained results into real medical devices
               since we are dealing with brain signals directly.Local field
               potentials (LFP) were recorded in the subthalamic nucleus of 7
               Parkinsonian patients through the implanted electrodes of a deep
               brain stimulation (DBS) device prior to its internalization.
               Measured LFP signals were preprocessed by means of splinting,
               down sampling, filtering, normalization and rectification. Then,
               feature extraction was conducted through a multi-level
               decomposition via a wavelet transform. Finally, artificial
               intelligence techniques were applied to feature selection,
               clustering of tremor types, and tremor detection.The key
               contribution of this paper is to present initial results which
               indicate, to a high degree of certainty, that there appear to be
               two distinct subgroups of patients within the group-1 of
               patients according to the Consensus Statement of the Movement
               Disorder Society on Tremor. Such results may well lead to
               different resultant treatments for the patients involved,
               depending on how their tremor has been classified.Moreover, we
               propose a new approach for demand driven stimulation, in which
               tremor detection is also based on the subtype of tremor the
               patient has. Applying this knowledge to the tremor detection
               problem, it can be concluded that the results improve when
               patient clustering is applied prior to detection.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could potentially be
               used to interact with pathological brain signals to intervene
               and ameliorate their effects in disease states. Here, we provide
               proof-of-principle of this approach by using a BCI to interpret
               pathological brain activity in patients with advanced Parkinson
               disease (PD) and to use this feedback to control when
               therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is delivered. Our goal
               was to demonstrate that by personalizing and optimizing
               stimulation in real time, we could improve on both the efficacy
               and efficiency of conventional continuous DBS. METHODS: We
               tested BCI-controlled adaptive DBS (aDBS) of the subthalamic
               nucleus in 8 PD patients. Feedback was provided by processing of
               the local field potentials recorded directly from the
               stimulation electrodes. The results were compared to no
               stimulation, conventional continuous stimulation (cDBS), and
               random intermittent stimulation. Both unblinded and blinded
               clinical assessments of motor effect were performed using the
               Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Motor scores
               improved by 66\% (unblinded) and 50\% (blinded) during aDBS,
               which were 29\% (p = 0.03) and 27\% (p = 0.005) better than
               cDBS, respectively. These improvements were achieved with a 56\%
               reduction in stimulation time compared to cDBS, and a
               corresponding reduction in energy requirements (p < 0.001). aDBS
               was also more effective than no stimulation and random
               intermittent stimulation. INTERPRETATION: BCI-controlled DBS is
               tractable and can be more efficient and efficacious than
               conventional continuous neuromodulation for PD.",

               of the stimulation to be analyzed separately to that of the
               surgery itself. A total of 430 patients who had received DBS for
               essential tremor were identified. Most of the reported adverse
               events were mild and could be treated through changing the

               a multidisciplinary team. Rigorous preoperative and

  abstract  = "It has been proposed that the efficacy of neuronal connections
               is strengthened when there is a persistent causal relationship
               between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. Such
               activity-dependent plasticity may underlie the reorganization of
               cortical representations during learning, although direct in
               vivo evidence is lacking. Here we show that stable
               reorganization of motor output can be induced by an artificial
               connection between two sites in the motor cortex of freely
               behaving primates. An autonomously operating electronic implant
               used action potentials recorded on one electrode to trigger
               electrical stimuli delivered at another location. Over one or
               more days of continuous operation, the output evoked from the
               recording site shifted to resemble the output from the
               corresponding stimulation site, in a manner consistent with the
               potentiation of synaptic connections between the artificially
               synchronized populations of neurons. Changes persisted in some
               cases for more than one week, whereas the output from sites not
               incorporated in the connection was unaffected. This method for
               inducing functional reorganization in vivo by using

               locations in the cerebral cortex. The primary motor area in the

               injury, disrupting communication between motor and somatosensory
               areas and resulting in impaired reaching and grasping abilities.
               After implantation of microelectrodes in cerebral cortex, a
               neural prosthesis discriminated action potentials (spikes) in
               premotor cortex that triggered electrical stimulation in

               substantially improved reaching and grasping functions that were

               individuals living with a chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).
               Healthcare for these individuals creates a significant economic

               everyday. Regaining partial function can lead to greater
               independence, thereby improving quality of life. To ascertain
               what functions are most important to the SCI population, in
               regard to enhancing quality of life, a novel survey was
               performed in which subjects were asked to rank seven functions
               in order of importance to their quality of life. The survey was
               distributed via email, postal mail, the internet, interview, and
               word of mouth to the SCI community at large. A total of 681

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to develop a new measure
               of victimization and perpetration of two frequent forms of
               image-based sexual abuse, namely sextortion (i.e., the threat of
               distributing sexual images to pressure the victim into doing
               something) and nonconsensual sexting (i.e., distributing sexual
               images of someone without the consent of the victim). Additional
               aims were to analyze the prevalence of these forms of
               victimization and perpetration and to examine their temporal
               stability over a 1-year period. METHODS: The sample was made up
               of 1820 Spanish adolescents (mean age = 13.38, SD = 1.42; 929
               girls, 878 boys, 3 nonbinary, and 10 did not indicate gender)
               who completed self-report instruments on image-based sexual
               abuse and related variables (e.g., cyberbullying victimization).
               RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported a structure
               composed of the four hypothesized factors: sextortion
               victimization and perpetration, and nonconsensual sexting
               victimization and perpetration. Higher sexting, cyberbullying
               victimization, and symptoms of depression and anxiety had
               stronger associations with image-based sexual victimization than
               with perpetration, which showed evidence of concurrent validity.
               Prevalence was 2.6\% and 0.7\% for sextortion victimization and
               perpetration, respectively, and 3.4\% and 4.9\% for
               nonconsensual sexting victimization and perpetration,
               respectively. Temporal stability over 1 year was .26 for
               sextortion victimization, .19 for nonconsensual sexting
               victimization, .33 for nonconsensual sexting perpetration (all
               ps < .001), and nonsignificant for sextortion perpetration. The
               stability of nonconsensual sexting victimization was
               significantly higher for girls compared to boys, whereas
               nonconsensual sexting perpetration was more stable over 1 year
               for boys. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies must advance the analysis
               of the predictors and consequences of image-based sexual abuse
               among adolescents to better prevent this problem. Prevalence of
               sextortion and nonconsensual sexting is not negligible, and
               these problems should be particularly addressed in prevention

  author   = "Zarzycki, Marcin Zygmunt and Domitrz, Izabela",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) was approved by Food and
              Drug Administration for Parkinson's disease, essential tremor,
              primary generalised or segmental dystonia and
              obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment. The exact
              mechanism of DBS remains unclear which causes side effects. The
              aim of this review was to assess variables causing
              stimulation-induced chronic psychiatric/personality-changing side
              effects. METHODS: The analysis of scientific database (PubMed,
              Cochrane Library, EMBASE) was conducted. The included articles
              had to be research study or case report and DBS to be conducted
              in therapeutic purposes. The researches with mental disorders in
              patients' medical histories were excluded. RESULTS: Seventeen
              articles were used in the review. In the group of movement
              disorders the characteristic of side effects was strongly related
              to the placement of the electrode implantation. Tiredness/fatigue
              was correlated with DBS in thalamus. Implantations in subthalamic
              nucleus were mostly followed by affective side effects such as
              depression or suicide. The higher voltage of electrode was
              connected with more severe depression after implantation. The
              analysis of affective disorder contained only three articles -
              two about OCD and one about depression. Forgetfulness and
              word-finding problems as activities connected with cognition may
              be an inevitable side effect if obsessive thoughts are to be
              inhibited. CONCLUSION: DBS of subthalamic nucleus should be seen
              as the most hazardous place of implantation. As a result there is
              a strong need of 'gold standards' based on the connectivity
              research and closer cooperation of scientists and clinicians.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Invasive monitoring is sometimes necessary to guide
              resective surgery in epilepsy patients, but the ideal method is
              unknown. In this systematic review, we assess the association of
              postresection seizure freedom and adverse events in
              stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and subdural electrodes
              (SDE). METHODS: We searched three electronic databases (MEDLINE,
              Embase, and CENTRAL [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
              Trials]) from their inception to January 2018 with the keywords
              ``electroencephalography,'' ``intracranial grid,'' and
              ``epilepsy.'' Studies that presented primary quantitative patient
              data for postresection seizure freedom with at least 1 year of
              follow-up or complication rates of SEEG- or SDE-monitored
              patients were included. Two trained investigators independently
              collected data from eligible studies. Weighted mean differences
              (WMDs) with 95\% confidence interval (CIs) were used as a measure
              of the association of SEEG or SDE with seizure freedom and with
              adverse event outcomes. RESULTS: Of 11 462 screened records, 48
              studies met inclusion criteria. These studies reported on 1973
              SEEG patients and 2036 SDE patients. Our systematic review
              revealed SEEG was associated with 61.0\% and SDE was associated
              with 56.4\% seizure freedom after resection (WMD = +5.8\%, 95\%
              CI = 4.7-6.9\%, P = .001). Furthermore, SEEG was associated with
              4.8\% and SDE was associated with 15.5\% morbidity (WMD =
              -10.6\%, 95\% CI = -11.6 to -9.6\%, P = .001). SEEG was
              associated with 0.2\% mortality and SDE was associated with 0.4\%
              mortality (WMD = -0.2\%, 95\% CI = -0.3 to -0.1\%, P = .001).
              SIGNIFICANCE: In this systematic review of SEEG and SDE invasive
              monitoring techniques, SEEG was associated with fewer surgical
              resections yet better seizure freedom outcomes in those
              undergoing resections. SEEG was also associated with lower
              mortality and morbidity than SDE. Clinical studies directly
              comparing these modalities are necessary to understand the
              relative rates of seizure freedom, morbidity, and mortality
              associated with these techniques.",

               oligomers is one of the earliest events in the molecular
               pathology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These oligomers lead to a
               variety of downstream effects, including impaired neuronal
               signaling, neuroinflammation, tau phosphorylation, and
               neurodegeneration, and it is estimated that these events begin
               10 to 20 y before the presentation of symptoms. Toxic A$\beta$
               oligomers contain a nonstandard protein structure, termed
               $\alpha$-sheet, and designed $\alpha$--sheet peptides target
               this main-chain structure in toxic oligomers independent of
               sequence. Here we show that a designed $\alpha$--sheet peptide
               inhibits the deleterious effects on neuronal signaling and also
               serves as a capture agent in our soluble oligomer binding assay
               (SOBA). Pre-incubated synthetic $\alpha$--sheet-containing
               A$\beta$ oligomers produce strong SOBA signals, while monomeric
               and $\beta$-sheet protofibrillar A$\beta$ do not.
               $\alpha$--sheet containing oligomers were also present in
               cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from an AD patient versus a
               noncognitively impaired control. For the detection of toxic
               oligomers in plasma, we developed a plate coating to increase
               the density of the capture peptide. The proof of concept was
               achieved by testing 379 banked human plasma samples. SOBA
               detected A$\beta$ oligomers in patients on the AD continuum,
               including controls who later progressed to mild cognitive
               impairment. In addition, SOBA discriminated AD from other forms
               of dementia, yielding sensitivity and specificity of 99\%
               relative to clinical and neuropathological diagnoses. To explore
               the broader potential of SOBA, we adapted the assay for
               a-synuclein oligomers and confirmed their presence in CSF from
               patients with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) impose significant
              financial and healthcare burden on populations all over the
              world. The prevalence and incidence of NDs have been observed to
              increase dramatically with age. Hence, the number of reported
              cases is projected to increase in the future, as life spans
              continues to rise. Despite this, there is limited effective
              treatment against most NDs. Interferons (IFNs), a family of
              cytokines, have been suggested as a promising therapeutic target
              for NDs, particularly IFN-$\alpha$, which governs various
              pathological pathways in different NDs. OBJECTIVE: This
              systematic review aimed to critically appraise the currently
              available literature on the pathological role of IFN-$\alpha$ in
              neurodegeneration/NDs. METHODS: Three databases, Scopus, PubMed,
              and Ovid Medline, were utilized for the literature search.
              RESULTS: A total of 77 journal articles were selected for
              critical evaluation, based on the inclusion and exclusion
              criteria. The studies selected and elucidated in this current
              systematic review have showed that IFN-$\alpha$ may play a
              deleterious role in neurodegenerative diseases through its strong
              association with the inflammatory processes resulting in mainly
              neurocognitive impairments. IFN-$\alpha$ may be displaying its
              neurotoxic function via various mechanisms such as abnormal
              calcium mineralization, activation of STAT1-dependent mechanisms,
              and increased quinolinic acid production. CONCLUSION: The exact
              role IFN-$\alpha$ in these neurodegenerative diseases have yet to
              be determine due to a lack in more recent evidence, thereby
              creating a variability in the role of IFN-$\alpha$. Future
              investigations should thus be conducted, so that the role played

              unknown state thought to represent a preclinical stage of
              Alzheimer's Disease (AD) previous to mild cognitive impairment
              (MCI). However, the course of network disruption in these stages
              is scarcely characterized. METHODS: We employed resting state
              magnetoencephalography in the source space to calculate network
              smallworldness, clustering, modularity and transitivity. Nodal
              measures (clustering and node degree) as well as modular
              partitions were compared between groups. RESULTS: The MCI group
              exhibited decreased smallworldness, clustering and transitivity
              and increased modularity in theta and beta bands. SCD showed
              similar but smaller changes in clustering and transitivity, while
              exhibiting alterations in the alpha band in opposite direction to
              those showed by MCI for modularity and transitivity. At the node
              level, MCI disrupted both clustering and nodal degree while SCD
              showed minor changes in the latter. Additionally, we observed an
              increase in modular partition variability in both SCD and MCI in
              theta and beta bands. CONCLUSION: SCD elders exhibit a
              significant network disruption, showing intermediate values
              between HC and MCI groups in multiple parameters. These results
              highlight the relevance of cognitive concerns in the clinical

              BCI and feasibility of using the system to control a computer by
              thought. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Stentrode With
              Thought-Controlled Digital Switch (SWITCH) study, a
              single-center, prospective, first in-human study, evaluated 5
              patients with severe bilateral upper-limb paralysis, with a
              follow-up of 12 months. From a referred sample, 4 patients with
              amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 1 with primary lateral
              sclerosis met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study.
              Surgical procedures and follow-up visits were performed at the
              Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Australia. Training sessions
              were performed at patients' homes and at a university clinic. The
              study start date was May 27, 2019, and final follow-up was
              completed January 9, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Recording devices were
              delivered via catheter and connected to subcutaneous electronic
              units. Devices communicated wirelessly to an external device for
              personal computer control. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The
              primary safety end point was device-related serious adverse
              events resulting in death or permanent increased disability.
              Secondary end points were blood vessel occlusion and device
              migration. Exploratory end points were signal fidelity and
              stability over 12 months, number of distinct commands created by
              neuronal activity, and use of system for digital device control.
              RESULTS: Of 4 patients included in analyses, all were male, and
              the mean (SD) age was 61 (17) years. Patients with preserved
              motor cortex activity and suitable venous anatomy were implanted.
              Each completed 12-month follow-up with no serious adverse events
              and no vessel occlusion or device migration. Mean (SD) signal
              bandwidth was 233 (16) Hz and was stable throughout study in all
              4 patients (SD range across all sessions, 7-32 Hz). At least 5
              attempted movement types were decoded offline, and each patient
              successfully controlled a computer with the BCI. CONCLUSIONS AND
              RELEVANCE: Endovascular access to the sensorimotor cortex is an
              alternative to placing BCI electrodes in or on the dura by
              open-brain surgery. These final safety and feasibility data from
              the first in-human SWITCH study indicate that it is possible to
              record neural signals from a blood vessel. The favorable safety
              profile could promote wider and more rapid translation of BCI to
              people with paralysis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

              (AD)-associated molecular phenomena, but how mitochondria impact

              Consider whether and how mitochondrial biology influences APOE
              and apoE biology. METHODS: We measured APOE expression in human
              SH-SY5Y neuronal cells with different forms of mitochondrial
              dysfunction including total, chronic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
              depletion ($\rho$0 cells); acute, partial mtDNA depletion; and
              toxin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. We further assessed
              intracellular and secreted apoE protein levels in the $\rho$0
              cells and interrogated the impact of transcription factors and
              stress signaling pathways known to influence APOE expression.
              RESULTS: SH-SY5Y $\rho$0 cells exhibited a 65-fold increase in
              APOE mRNA, an 8-fold increase in secreted apoE protein, and
              increased intracellular apoE protein. Other models of primary
              mitochondrial dysfunction including partial mtDNA-depletion,
              toxin-induced respiratory chain inhibition, and chemical-induced
              manipulations of the mitochondrial membrane potential similarly
              increased SH-SY5Y cell APOE mRNA. We explored potential mediators
              and found in the $\rho$0 cells knock-down of the C/EBP$\alpha$
              and NFE2L2 (Nrf2) transcription factors reduced APOE mRNA. The
              activity of two mitogen-activated protein kinases, JNK and ERK,
              also strongly influenced $\rho$0 cell APOE mRNA levels.
              CONCLUSION: Primary mitochondrial dysfunction either directly or
              indirectly activates APOE expression in a neuronal cell model by
              altering transcription factors and stress signaling pathways.
              These studies demonstrate mitochondrial biology can influence the
              biology of the APOE gene and apoE protein, which are implicated

              characteristics of SCD associated with amyloid pathology remain
              unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the associations between
              SCD characteristics with amyloid pathology. METHODS: Using
              logistic regression analyses, we analyzed the associations
              between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid pathology with AD risk
              factors, SCD-specific characteristics (onset of SCD within the
              last five years, age at onset $\geq$60 years, feelings of worse
              performance, informant confirmation of complaints, worries, other
              domains of cognition complaints), as well as subthreshold
              depressive and anxiety symptoms among individuals with SCD.
              RESULTS: A total of 535 SCD individuals with available CSF
              A$\beta$ 42 information from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker
              and LifestylE (CABLE) study (mean age of 63.5 years, range 40 to
              88 years; 47.10\% female) were enrolled. The characteristics of
              informant confirmation of complaints (OR, 95\% CI = 2.00,
              1.19-3.36), subthreshold depressive symptoms (OR, 95\% CI = 2.31,

              onset of isoluminant chromatic (red-green) and high contrast
              achromatic sinusoidal gratings were used for stimulating the
              P-system. A chromatic stimulation evoked a characteristic
              negative wave (N1) with peak latencies around 120 msec. The
              amplitude showed an inverse U-shaped function as a function of
              spatial frequency with a peak at 2 c/deg. In contrast, VEPs to
              achromatic (black-white) gratings showed different spatial
              frequency characteristics with a peak at 5.3 c/deg. By varying
              the luminous intensity ratio between the red and green gratings,
              N1 was found to reach a maximum during isoluminant stimulation.
              An apparent motion display was used for stimulating the M-system.
              The speed of alternation (i.e., the interstimulus interval (ISI))
              was varied to record both the transient and steady-state VEPs.
              Transient VEPs showed triphasic waves with the major positive
              peak (P1) at around 120 ms. Steady-state VEPs were
              quasi-sinusoidal waveforms, depending on the ISI, and were quite
              stable across all subjects. There was a also high correlation
              between the motion threshold and the VEP amplitude. The above
              observations indicate that characteristic potentials may
              distinguish between these two parallel visual systems in humans.
              Thus, the combined use of isoluminant color and high contrast

              methods for extracting chemical information from Near Infrared
              (NIR) spectroscopic measurements. The success of a PLS
              calibration relies largely on the representativeness of the
              calibration data set. This is not trivial, because not only the
              expected variation in the analyte of interest, but also the
              variation of other contributing factors (interferents) should be
              included in the calibration data. This also implies that changes
              in interferent concentrations not covered in the calibration step
              can deteriorate the prediction ability of the calibration model.
              Several researchers have suggested that PLS models can be
              robustified against changes in the interferent structure by
              incorporating expert knowledge in the preprocessing step with the
              aim to efficiently filter out the spectral influence of the
              spectral interferents. However, these methods have not yet been
              compared against each other. Therefore, in the present study,
              various preprocessing techniques exploiting expert knowledge were

              in the Extended Multiplicative Signal Correction framework.
              Similarly, for data set-2, nearly 63\% improvement in the

              biomarker (BBM) of Alzheimer's disease pathology. We explored
              clinicians' experience of the utility of plasma p-tau181 in
              Camden and Islington Memory Services. METHODS: Patients were
              identified by their clinician as appropriate for p-tau181. Their
              p-tau181 result was plotted on a reference range graph provided
              to clinicians. This was discussed with the patient at diagnostic
              feedback appointment. RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants' plasma
              p-tau181 samples were included (mean age 74 SD 8.5, 65\% female).
              Nine clinicians participated in the study. Eighty-six percent of
              clinicians found the p-tau181 result to be helpful and in 93\% of
              cases it was clearly understandable. The p-tau181 result was
              useful in making the diagnosis in 44\% of cases. CONCLUSIONS:
              Plasma p-tau181 is a feasible test for use in memory services and
              acceptable to clinicians. Clinician feedback on utility in
              dementia diagnoses was mixed. Further work is required to provide

               in improving stimulation outcomes and reducing

               of human intracortical responses to electrical stimulation in
               invasive electroencephalography. In epilepsy patients (n=4)
               undergoing clinical monitoring, we applied a stimulation
               protocol of varying amplitude and frequency in 5-second
               intervals to capture a range of responses to different
               stimulation conditions. We characterized these responses using
               time-frequency spectral power, applied baseline subtraction and
               outlier removal procedures, and performed principal component
               analysis across frequencies. We identified that intracortical
               responses to different stimulation conditions can be represented
               in a 3-dimensional subspace, accounting for more than 95\% of
               the variance. Using support vector machine classification, we
               demonstrated separability of intracortical responses in
               different stimulation conditions across subjects, where this
               separability was contingent on applying baseline subtraction and
               outlier removal. Our results represent a first step towards
               building a predictive model of neural response from stimulation

              control group (n = 101) of cognitively healthy subjects was

               disappointing results of clinical trials targeting the primary
               amyloid and tau pathology. On the other hand, deep brain
               stimulation (DBS) has demonstrated success in other neurological
               and psychiatric disorders leading to great interest in DBS as a
               treatment for Alzheimer's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
               review the literature on 1) circuit dysfunction in Alzheimer's
               disease and 2) DBS for Alzheimer's disease. Human and animal
               studies are reviewed individually. RESULTS: There is
               accumulating evidence of neural circuit dysfunction at the
               structural, functional, electrophysiological, and
               neurotransmitter level. Recent evidence from humans and animals

               and psychiatric disorders, and may even slow or reverse the
               underlying disease pathophysiology. CONCLUSIONS: DBS is an
               intriguing potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease,
               targeting circuit dysfunction as a novel therapeutic target.
               However, further exploration of the basic disease pathology and
               underlying mechanisms of DBS is necessary to better understand

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: GBA mutations are the most common known
              genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Its biological pathway
              may be important in idiopathic PD, since activity of the enzyme
              encoded by GBA, glucocerebrosidase, is reduced even among PD
              patients without GBA mutations. This article describes the
              structure and function of GBA, reviews recent literature on the
              clinical phenotype of GBA PD, and suggests future directions for
              research, counseling, and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Several
              longitudinal studies have shown that GBA PD has faster motor and
              cognitive progression than idiopathic PD and that this effect is
              dose dependent. New evidence suggests that GBA mutations may be
              important in multiple system atrophy. Further, new interventional
              studies focusing on GBA PD are described. These studies may
              increase the interest of PD patients and caregivers in genetic
              counseling. GBA mutation status may help clinicians estimate PD
              progression, though mechanisms underlying GBA and synucleinopathy
              require further understanding.",

              network measures derived from electroencephalography (EEG),

              normal (PD-CN) and matched healthy controls; and between PD-CN
              and PD dementia (PD-D). METHODS: EEG recordings were analyzed via
              graph theory network analysis to quantify changes in global
              efficiency and local integration. This included minimal spanning
              tree analysis. T-tests and correlations were used to assess
              differences between groups and assess the relationship with
              cognitive performance. RESULTS: Network measures showed increased
              local integration across all frequency bands between control and
              PD-CN; in contrast, decreased local integration occurred in PD-D
              when compared to PD-CN in the alpha1 frequency band. Differences

              performance in distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
              from normal control (NC) compared to an objective cognitive
              screen (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]). METHODS: One
              hundred ninety-four community-dwelling non-demented older adults
              with racial/ethnic diversity were included. Unidimensionality and
              internal consistency of the CFI were examined using factor
              analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and McDonald's omega. Logistic
              regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
              analysis were used to examine the performance of CFI. RESULTS:
              The CFI demonstrated adequate internal consistency; however, the
              fit for a unidimensional model was suboptimal. The CFI
              distinguished MCI from NC alone or in combination with MoCA. ROC
              analysis showed comparable performance of the CFI and the MoCA.
              DISCUSSION: Our findings support the use of CFI as a brief and
              easy-to-use screen to detect MCI in culturally/linguistically
              diverse older adults. HIGHLIGHT: What is the key scientific
              question or problem of central interest of the paper? Subjective
              cognitive complaints (SCCs) are considered the earliest sign of
              dementia in older adults. However, it is unclear if SCC are
              equivalent in different cultures. The Cognitive Function
              Instrument (CFI) is a 14-item measure of SCC. This study provides
              pilot data suggesting that CFI is sensitive for detecting mild
              cognitive impairment in a cohort of older adults with
              racial/ethnic diversity. Comparing performance, CFI demonstrates
              comparable sensitivity to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, an
              objective cognitive screening test. Overall, SCC may provide a
              non-invasive, easy-to-use method to flag possible cognitive
              impairment in both research and clinical settings.",

               interact in 3D environments but is limited by motor and sensor
               limitations. To circumvent these limitations, we propose a
               vergence-based motion correlation method to detect visual
               attention toward very small targets. Smooth depth movements
               relative to the user are induced on 3D objects, which cause slow
               vergence eye movements when looked upon. Using the principle of
               motion correlation, the depth movements of the object and
               vergence eye movements are matched to determine which object the
               user is focussing on. In two user studies, we demonstrate how
               the technique can reliably infer gaze attention on very small
               targets, systematically explore how different stimulus motions
               affect attention detection, and show how the technique can be
               extended to multi-target selection. Finally, we provide example
               applications using the concept and design guidelines for small

              illusions of agency. There are times when users feel as if they
              are in control when in fact they are merely responding to stimuli
              on the screen in predictable ways. After the introduction, the
              second section of the article offers examples of illusions of
              agency that do not involve human--computer interaction in order
              to show that such illusions are possible and not terribly
              uncommon. The third and fourth sections of the article cover
              relevant work from empirical psychology, including the cues that
              are known to generate the sense of agency. The fifth section of
              the article shows that our devices are designed to deliver
              precisely those cues. In the sixth section, the argument is
              completed with evidence that users frequently use their
              smartphones without the sort of intentional supervision involved
              in genuine agency. This sixth section includes the introduction
              of Digital Environmental Dependency Syndrome (DEDS) as a possible
              way of characterizing extended use of the smartphone without
              genuine agency. In the final section of the article, there is a
              discussion of questions raised by the main claim, including
              suggestions for reducing occurrences of illusions of agency

              provide a stronger empirical foundation for theoretical

                   to optimize against a reward model trained to predict human
                   preferences. Because the reward model is an imperfect proxy,
                   optimizing its value too much can hinder ground truth
                   performance, in accordance with Goodhart's law. This effect
                   has been frequently observed, but not carefully measured due
                   to the expense of collecting human preference data. In this
                   work, we use a synthetic setup in which a fixed
                   ``gold-standard'' reward model plays the role of humans,
                   providing labels used to train a proxy reward model. We
                   study how the gold reward model score changes as we optimize
                   against the proxy reward model using either reinforcement
                   learning or best-of-$n$ sampling. We find that this

                   on the method of optimization, and that in both cases its
                   coefficients scale smoothly with the number of reward model
                   parameters. We also study the effect on this relationship of
                   the size of the reward model dataset, the number of reward
                   model and policy parameters, and the coefficient of the KL

              electrical stimulation therapy (BCI-FEST) has shown promise as a
              therapy to improve upper extremity function for individuals who
              have had a stroke or spinal cord injury. The next step is to
              determine whether BCI-FEST could be used clinically as part of
              broader therapy practice. To do this, we need to understand
              therapists' opinions on using the BCI-FEST and what limitations
              potentially exist. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative
              exploratory study to understand the perspectives of therapists on
              their experiences delivering BCI-FEST and the feasibility of
              large-scale clinical implementation. METHODS: Semi-structured
              interviews were conducted with physical therapists (PTs) and
              occupational therapists (OTs) who have delivered BCI-FEST.
              Interview questions were developed using the COM-B (Capability,
              Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour) model of behaviour change.
              COM-B components were used to inform deductive content analysis
              while other subthemes were detected using an inductive approach.
              RESULTS: We interviewed PTs (n = 3) and OTs (n = 3), with 360
              combined hours of experience delivering BCI-FEST. Components and
              subcomponents of the COM-B determined deductively included: (1)
              Capability (physical, psychological), (2) Opportunity (physical,
              social), and (3) Motivation (automatic, reflective). Under each
              deductive subcomponent, one to two inductive subthemes were
              identified (n = 8). Capability and Motivation were perceived as
              strengths, and therefore supported therapists' decisions to use
              BCI-FEST. Under Opportunity, for both subcomponents (physical,
              social), therapists recognized the need for more support to
              clinically implement BCI-FEST. CONCLUSIONS: We identified
              facilitating and limiting factors to BCI-FEST delivery in a
              clinical setting according to clinicians. These factors implied
              that education, training, a support network or mentors, and
              restructuring the physical environment (e.g., scheduling) should
              be targeted as interventions. The results of this study may help

              increasing 'real-worldness', starting with laboratory tests of
              stopping of speech, gait and bodily functions, and then going
              beyond the laboratory to consider neural recordings and
              stimulation during moments of control presumably required in
              everyday activities such as walking and driving. We end by asking
              whether stopping research has clinical relevance, focusing on
              movement disorders such as stuttering, tics and freezing of gait.
              Overall, we conclude there are hints that the prefrontal-basal

              iEEG research practices in a didactic framework for newcomers, as
              well addressing issues encountered by proficient researchers. The

              (ii) suggest potential guidelines for working with iEEG data and

              sensory, motor, or structural knowledge about the world. While
              the implied existence of a one-to-one mapping between external
              referents and neural firing has been useful, the prevalence of
              adaptation challenges this. Adaptation provides neural responses
              with dynamics on timescales that range from milliseconds up to
              many seconds. These timescales are highly relevant for sensory
              experience in the natural world, in which local statistical
              properties of inputs change continuously, and are additionally
              altered by active sensing. Adaptation has a number of

              discuss the proposal that such attenuation of self-produced
              tactile stimulation is due to the sensory predictions made by an
              internal forward model of the motor system. A forward model
              predicts the sensory consequences of a movement based on the
              motor command. When a movement is self-produced, its sensory
              consequences can be accurately predicted, and this prediction can
              be used to attenuate the sensory effects of the movement. Studies
              are reviewed that demonstrate that as the discrepancy between
              predicted and actual sensory feedback increases during
              self-produced tactile stimulation there is a concomitant decrease
              in the level of sensory attenuation and an increase in
              tickliness. Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated
              that this sensory attenuation might be mediated by somatosensory

              less by a self-produced tactile stimulus than by the same
              stimulus when it is externally produced. Furthermore, evidence

              Because it is slow, expensive, or often infeasible to directly
              measure the wiring diagrams of neural microcircuits, there has
              long been an interest in estimating them from neural recordings.
              We show that even sophisticated inference algorithms, applied to
              large volumes of data from every node in the circuit, are biased
              toward inferring connections between unconnected but strongly
              correlated neurons, a situation that is common in strongly

              ``explain away'' non-existent connections when correlations are

              dynamics and the generative model assumed for inference, an

              behavior while learning a perceptual task. We find systematic

              electrosensory input, we show that these behavioral adjustments
              improve the sensory input. As we find low neuronal detection
              thresholds at the level of medullary electrosensory neurons, it
              seems that the behavior-driven improvements of the sensory input

              moving individuals. We sought to directly test whether
              stimulation-related improvements in bradykinesia were contingent
              on reduction of beta power and burst durations, and/or the volume
              of the sensorimotor subthalamic nucleus that was modulated. We
              recorded synchronized local field potentials and kinematic data
              in 16 subthalamic nuclei of individuals with Parkinson's disease
              chronically implanted with neurostimulators during a repetitive
              wrist-flexion extension task, while administering randomized
              different intensities of high frequency stimulation. Increased
              intensities of deep brain stimulation improved movement velocity
              and were associated with an intensity-dependent reduction in beta
              power and mean burst duration, measured during movement. The
              degree of reduction in this beta oscillopathy was associated with
              the improvement in movement velocity. Moreover, the reduction in
              beta power and beta burst durations was dependent on the
              theoretical degree of tissue modulated in the sensorimotor region
              of the subthalamic nucleus. Finally, the degree of attenuation of
              both beta power and beta burst durations, together with the
              degree of overlap of stimulation with the sensorimotor
              subthalamic nucleus significantly explained the
              stimulation-related improvement in movement velocity. The above
              results provide direct evidence that subthalamic nucleus deep
              brain stimulation-related improvements in bradykinesia are
              related to the reduction in beta oscillopathy within the
              sensorimotor region. With the advent of sensing neurostimulators,
              this beta oscillopathy combined with lead location could be used
              as a marker for real-time feedback to adjust clinical settings or
              to drive closed-loop deep brain stimulation in freely moving
              individuals with Parkinson's disease.",

  abstract = "How the neocortex works is a mystery. In this paper we propose a
              novel framework for understanding its function. Grid cells are
              neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent the location of
              an animal in its environment. Recent evidence suggests that grid
              cell-like neurons may also be present in the neocortex. We
              propose that grid cells exist throughout the neocortex, in every
              region and in every cortical column. They define a location-based
              framework for how the neocortex functions. Whereas grid cells in
              the entorhinal cortex represent the location of one thing, the
              body relative to its environment, we propose that cortical grid
              cells simultaneously represent the location of many things.
              Cortical columns in somatosensory cortex track the location of
              tactile features relative to the object being touched and
              cortical columns in visual cortex track the location of visual
              features relative to the object being viewed. We propose that
              mechanisms in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that evolved
              for learning the structure of environments are now used by the
              neocortex to learn the structure of objects. Having a
              representation of location in each cortical column suggests
              mechanisms for how the neocortex represents object
              compositionality and object behaviors. It leads to the hypothesis
              that every part of the neocortex learns complete models of
              objects and that there are many models of each object distributed
              throughout the neocortex. The similarity of circuitry observed in
              all cortical regions is strong evidence that even high-level
              cognitive tasks are learned and represented in a location-based
              framework.",

  abstract = "Operant conditioning of neural activity has typically been
              performed under controlled behavioral conditions using food
              reinforcement. This has limited the duration and behavioral
              context for neural conditioning. To reward cell activity in
              unconstrained primates, we sought sites in nucleus accumbens
              (NAc) whose stimulation reinforced operant responding. In three
              monkeys, NAc stimulation sustained performance of a manual
              target-tracking task, with response rates that increased
              monotonically with increasing NAc stimulation. We recorded
              activity of single motor cortex neurons and documented their
              modulation with wrist force. We conditioned increased firing

              free behavior in the cage using an autonomous head-fixed
              recording and stimulating system. Spikes occurring above baseline
              rates triggered single or multiple electrical pulses to the
              reinforcement site. Such rate-contingent, unit-triggered
              stimulation was made available for periods of 1-3 min separated
              by 3-10 min time-out periods. Feedback was presented as
              event-triggered clicks both in-cage and in-booth, and visual cues
              were provided in many in-booth sessions. In-booth conditioning
              produced increases in single neuron firing probability with
              intracranial reinforcement in 48 of 58 cells. Reinforced cell
              activity could rise more than five times that of non-reinforced
              activity. In-cage conditioning produced significant increases in
              21 of 33 sessions. In-cage rate changes peaked later and lasted
              longer than in-booth changes, but were often comparatively
              smaller, between 13 and 18\% above non-reinforced activity. Thus
              intracranial stimulation reinforced volitional increases in
              cortical firing rates during both free behavior and a controlled
              environment, although changes in the latter were more robust.NEW

              being initially developed for visual processing, the bulk of
              predictive coding research has subsequently focused on auditory

              electrical stimulation of peripheral muscles and nerves, known as

              FES systems through other preserved, but unrelated and limited in
              number, volitional movements (eg, facial muscle activity, head
              movements, shoulder shrugs). We report the findings of an
              individual with traumatic high-cervical spinal cord injury who
              coordinated reaching and grasping movements using his own
              paralysed arm and hand, reanimated through implanted FES, and
              commanded using his own cortical signals through an intracortical
              brain-computer interface (iBCI). METHODS: We recruited a
              participant into the BrainGate2 clinical trial, an ongoing study
              that obtains safety information regarding an intracortical neural
              interface device, and investigates the feasibility of people with
              tetraplegia controlling assistive devices using their cortical
              signals. Surgical procedures were performed at University
              Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). Study
              procedures and data analyses were performed at Case Western
              Reserve University (Cleveland, OH, USA) and the US Department of
              Veterans Affairs, Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical
              Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). The study participant was a
              53-year-old man with a spinal cord injury (cervical level 4,
              American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale category A).
              He received two intracortical microelectrode arrays in the hand
              area of his motor cortex, and 4 months and 9 months later
              received a total of 36 implanted percutaneous electrodes in his
              right upper and lower arm to electrically stimulate his hand,
              elbow, and shoulder muscles. The participant used a motorised
              mobile arm support for gravitational assistance and to provide
              humeral abduction and adduction under cortical control. We
              assessed the participant's ability to cortically command his
              paralysed arm to perform simple single-joint arm and hand
              movements and functionally meaningful multi-joint movements. We
              compared iBCI control of his paralysed arm with that of a virtual
              three-dimensional arm. This study is registered with
              ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00912041. FINDINGS: The
              intracortical implant occurred on Dec 1, 2014, and we are
              continuing to study the participant. The last session included in
              this report was Nov 7, 2016. The point-to-point target
              acquisition sessions began on Oct 8, 2015 (311 days after
              implant). The participant successfully cortically commanded
              single-joint and coordinated multi-joint arm movements for
              point-to-point target acquisitions (80-100\% accuracy), using
              first a virtual arm and second his own arm animated by FES. Using
              his paralysed arm, the participant volitionally performed
              self-paced reaches to drink a mug of coffee (successfully
              completing 11 of 12 attempts within a single session 463 days
              after implant) and feed himself (717 days after implant).

              combined implanted FES+iBCI neuroprosthesis for restoring both
              reaching and grasping movements to people with chronic
              tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury, and represents a major

                 cognitive disability in adults, often characterized by marked
                 deficits in episodic memory and executive function. Prior
                 studies have found that direct electrical stimulation of the
                 temporal cortex yielded improved memory in epilepsy patients,
                 but it is not clear if these results generalize to patients
                 with a specific history of TBI. Here we asked whether applying
                 closed-loop, direct electrical stimulation to lateral temporal
                 cortex could reliably improve memory in a TBI cohort. Among a
                 larger group of patients undergoing neurosurgical evaluation
                 for refractory epilepsy, we recruited a subset patients with a
                 history of moderate-to-severe TBI. By analyzing neural data
                 from indwelling electrodes as patients studied and recalled
                 lists of words, we trained personalized machine-learning
                 classifiers to predict momentary fluctuations in mnemonic
                 function in each patient. We subsequently used these
                 classifiers to trigger high-frequency stimulation of the
                 lateral temporal cortex (LTC) at moments when memory was
                 predicted to fail. This strategy yielded a 19\% boost in
                 recall performance on stimulated as compared with
                 non-stimulated lists (P = 0.012). These results provide a
                 proof-of-concept for using closed-loop stimulation of the

              participants (20 professional taxi drivers and 30 young
              non-professional drivers) driving the simulator-cab in three
              conditions. The first test session (TS1) was conducted after one
              night of PSD followed by the second test (TS2) after two
              consecutive nights of PSD. The driving performance metrics in two
              conditions of PSD (i.e., sleep duration = 4.25 $\pm$ 0.5 h) were
              compared with the baseline drive with no sleep loss. Sleep
              restriction was monitored using Actiwatch. Drivers subjectively
              self-reported their alertness using Karolinska Sleepiness Scale
              (KSS). Driving performance metrics and reaction time to emergency
              events were collected during each drive. Results A preliminary
              mixed-design ANOVA showed deterioration in driving performance of
              all drivers in terms of speed (p < 0.1), speed variability (p =
              0.06), standard deviation in lateral positions (SDLP) (p < 0.001)

              Generalized Linear Models for professional and non-professional
              drivers showed that speed variability, SDLP and reaction time
              increased from baseline during both the PSD tests, among both the

              professional drivers differed significantly from other drivers
              under PSD conditions. Contrary to the existing belief, the
              professional drivers had significant decrements in driving
              performance due to PSD. Conclusion A critical and comparative
              analysis revealed that driving experience/skill of professional
              drivers does not improve their resistance to deteriorating
              effects of sleep loss.",

              Furthermore, recent behavioral studies have shown that viewing

              ability at the stimulated site. This study aims to investigate
              the role of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) during
              visuotactile integration processes. Subjects looked at a hand in
              a video being touched on the first digit (D1) in synchrony with
              felt touches on their real hidden hand as compared with watching
              a video with asynchronous touches. During synchronous

              the video hand, thus indicating that in this condition the
              subjects regarded the video hand as their own touched hand. This
              feeling disappeared in the asynchronous condition. Using

              functional organization of SI related to tactile stimulation of

              significantly positively correlated with the feeling that the

              physical aspects of peripheral stimulation. Here, we created a
              simple illusion of feeling an elongated arm by using the
              dominance of the visual domain over the tactile sense: employing
              an artificial hand and arm, which were connected to the body,
              subjects were given the visual impression that they had an
              extended arm. Since it is known from animal studies that tactile
              illusions alter early sensory processing in SI, we expected a
              modulation of the topography in SI corresponding to this

              the cortical distance between first (D1) and fifth digit (D5)

              spontaneous activity in the beta band and drives evoked resonant
              neural activity (ERNA). Here, we investigate how STN LFP
              activities change over time following the onset and offset of
              DBS. To this end we recorded LFPs from the STN in 14 PD patients
              during long (mean: 181.2 s) and short (14.2 s) blocks of
              continuous stimulation at 130 Hz. LFP activities were evaluated
              in the temporal and spectral domains. During long stimulation
              blocks, the frequency and amplitude of the ERNA decreased before
              reaching a steady state after ~70 s. Maximal ERNA amplitudes
              diminished over repeated stimulation blocks. Upon DBS cessation,
              the ERNA was revealed as an under-damped oscillation, and was
              more marked and lasted longer after short duration stimulation
              blocks. In contrast, activity in the beta band suppressed within
              0.5 s of continuous DBS onset and drifted less over time.
              Spontaneous activity was also suppressed in the low gamma band,
              suggesting that the effects of high frequency stimulation on
              spontaneous oscillations may not be selective for pathological
              beta activity. High frequency oscillations were present in only
              six STN recordings before stimulation onset and their frequency
              was depressed by stimulation. The different dynamics of the ERNA
              and beta activity with stimulation imply different DBS mechanisms

               general relativity with the theory of elasticity by considering
               the cosmological constant ? as an additional space curvature of
               the structure of space due to a thermal gradient coming from the
               cosmic web and the cold vacuum and we propose ($\alpha$S?T e )2
               = ( 1 R0 )2 = ? with R0 being the curvature radius of the space
               fabric. It follows from this analogy and from the supposed space
               model consisting of thin sheets of Planck thickness lp curved by
               this thermal gradient ?T a possible thermal expansion
               coefficient of the equivalent elastic medium modeling the space
               $\alpha$S = lp? ?T of the order of $\alpha$space-QFT = 1.16 ?
               10?6K?1. As spacetime and not only space must be considered in
               general relativity, this paper also proposes an innovative
               approach which consists in introducing into the interval ds2 of
               special relativity a temperature effect T : ds2 = (1 $\pm$
               $\alpha$ tT)2c2dt2 ? (1 $\pm$ $\alpha$ sT)2[dx2 + dy2+dz2]
               (entropy variations correlated with time laps, based on
               temperature variations affecting always physically the clocks)
               based on different thermal expansion coefficients for space and
               time with for the flow of time t : ct cn$\tau$ = kBt nh ? ?T =
               $\alpha$t?T. With T $\approx$ 106K, n = 1, the associate time
               interval is 4.8 ? 10?17s and $\alpha$t = 1.0 ? 10?6K?1. The
               consequence of this hypothesis is that dark energy potentially
               becomes a thermal spacetime curvature ($\alpha$fT lp )2 with f
               equal to s or t depending of the temperature, the thermal
               entropy variation of the universe, the Planck thickness and
               time, that increases since the Big bang, depending on thermal
               expansion coefficients for spacetime $\alpha$s and $\alpha$t as
               a function, respectively, of ?, kB h ? t, in opposition to
               spacetime curvature gravity due to mass/energy density as

  abstract = "Based on a material view and reductionism, science has achieved
              great success. These cognitive paradigms treat the external as an
              objective existence and ignore internal consciousness. However,
              this cognitive paradigm, which we take for granted, has also led
              to some dilemmas related to consciousness in biology and physics.
              Together, these phenomena reveal the interaction and inseparable
              side of matter and consciousness (or body and mind) rather than
              the absolute opposition. However, a material view that describes
              matter and consciousness in opposition cannot explain the
              underlying principle, which causes a gap in interpretation. For
              example, consciousness is believed to be the key to influencing
              wave function collapse (reality), but there is a lack of a
              scientific model to study how this happens. In this study, we
              reveal that the theory of scientific cognition exhibits a
              paradigm shift in terms of perception. This tendency implies that
              reconciling the relationship between matter and consciousness
              requires an abstract theoretical model that is not based on
              physical forms. We propose that the holistic cognitive paradigm
              offers a potential solution to reconcile the dilemmas and can be
              scientifically proven. In contrast to the material view, the
              holistic cognitive paradigm is based on the objective
              contradictory nature of perception rather than the external
              physical characteristics. This cognitive paradigm relies on
              perception and experience (not observation) and summarizes all
              existence into two abstract contradictory perceptual states
              (Yin-Yang). Matter and consciousness can be seen as two different
              states of perception, unified in perception rather than in
              opposition. This abstract perspective offers a distinction from
              the material view, which is also the key to falsification, and
              the occurrence of an event is inseparable from the irrational
              state of the observer's conscious perception. Alternatively, from
              the material view, the event is random and has nothing to do with
              perception. We hope that this study can provide some new
              enlightenment for the scientific coordination of the opposing
              relationship between matter and consciousness.",

              hardware that should be considered by the researchers.
              Subsequently, a meta-analysis of 44 neuroscientific or
              neuropsychological studies involving VR HMD systems was
              performed. The meta-analysis of the VR studies demonstrated that

              provide sensory information about the position of the limb in
              space and about objects grasped in the hand. One approach to
              restoring touch and proprioception consists of electrically

              eliciting meaningful sensations to support the dexterous use of

                   are generally noisy, and temporal filters have been
                   extensively used for regularization. One of the most
                   widely-used methods is the Kalman filter, which is both
                   extremely simple and general. However, Kalman filters
                   require a motion model and measurement model to be specified
                   a priori, which burdens the modeler and simultaneously
                   demands that we use explicit models that are often only
                   crude approximations of reality. For example, in the
                   pose-estimation tasks mentioned above, it is common to use
                   motion models that assume constant velocity or constant
                   acceleration, and we believe that these simplified
                   representations are severely inhibitive. In this work, we
                   propose to instead learn rich, dynamic representations of
                   the motion and noise models. In particular, we propose
                   learning these models from data using long short term
                   memory, which allows representations that depend on all
                   previous observations and all previous states. We evaluate
                   our method using three of the most popular pose estimation
                   tasks in computer vision, and in all cases we obtain
                   state-of-the-art performance.",

              function of a native human arm and the refinement of algorithms
              that decode intended movements from brain activity. However,

              our current understanding about how information about grasped
              objects is encoded in the brain of intact individuals. I argue
              that not only can sensory neuroscience inform the development of
              sensory neuroprostheses, but also that the converse is true:
              stimulating the brain offers an exceptional opportunity to

              signals to sensory cortices. It remains unclear whether these

              they also encode sensory experience and expectation. Here, we
              combine closed-loop behavior with large-scale physiology,
              projection-pattern specific recordings, and circuit perturbations
              to show that neurons in mouse secondary motor cortex (M2) encode
              sensation and are influenced by expectation. When a movement
              unexpectedly produces a sound, M2 becomes dominated by
              sound-evoked activity. Sound responses in M2 are inherited
              partially from the auditory cortex and are routed back to the
              auditory cortex, providing a path for the dynamic exchange of
              sensory-motor information during behavior. When the acoustic
              consequences of a movement become predictable, M2 responses to
              self-generated sounds are selectively gated off. These changes in
              single-cell responses are reflected in population dynamics, which
              are influenced by both sensation and expectation. Together, these

              VR-EAL in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game
              assistance, and VRISE. Twenty-five participants aged between 20
              and 45 years with 12--16 years of full-time education evaluated
              various versions of VR-EAL. The final version of VR-EAL achieved
              high scores in every sub-score of the VRNQ and exceeded its
              parsimonious cut-offs. It also appeared to have better in-game

              substantially increased the quality of the user experience and
              almost eradicated VRISE. The results substantially support the

              However, the direct electrophysiological correlates of body
              ownership at the cortical level remain unexplored. To address
              this, we studied the rubber hand illusion in 5 patients (3 males

              cortical surface potentials. Increased high-$\gamma$ (70-200 Hz)

              mnemonic and executive tasks, yet the mechanisms governing its
              development are still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that already
              in neonatal rats, patterns of discontinuous oscillatory activity
              precisely entrain the firing of prefrontal neurons and have
              distinct spatial and temporal organization over cingulate and

              bursts drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations
              by phase-locking the neuronal firing via axonal pathways.
              Consequently, functional impairment of the hippocampus reduces
              the prefrontal activity. With ongoing maturation continuous
              theta-gamma oscillations emerge and mutually entrain the

              theta-modulated communication within developing

  abstract = "The brain networks supporting nausea not yet understood. We
              previously found that while visual stimulation activated primary
              (V1) and extrastriate visual cortices (MT+/V5, coding for visual
              motion), increasing nausea was associated with increasing
              sustained activation in several brain areas, with significant
              co-activation for anterior insula (aIns) and mid-cingulate (MCC)
              cortices. Here, we hypothesized that motion sickness also alters
              functional connectivity between visual motion and previously
              identified nausea-processing brain regions. Subjects prone to
              motion sickness and controls completed a motion sickness
              provocation task during fMRI/ECG acquisition. We studied changes
              in connectivity between visual processing areas activated by the
              stimulus (MT+/V5, V1), right aIns and MCC when comparing rest
              (BASELINE) to peak nausea state (NAUSEA). Compared to BASELINE,
              NAUSEA reduced connectivity between right and left V1 and
              increased connectivity between right MT+/V5 and aIns and between
              left MT+/V5 and MCC. Additionally, the change in MT+/V5 to insula
              connectivity was significantly associated with a change in
              sympathovagal balance, assessed by heart rate variability
              analysis. No state-related connectivity changes were noted for
              the control group. Increased connectivity between a visual motion
              processing region and nausea/salience brain regions may reflect
              increased transfer of visual/vestibular mismatch information to
              brain regions supporting nausea perception and autonomic
              processing. We conclude that vection-induced nausea increases
              connectivity between nausea-processing regions and those
              activated by the nauseogenic stimulus. This enhanced
              low-frequency coupling may support continual, slowly evolving
              nausea perception and shifts toward sympathetic dominance.
              Disengaging this coupling may be a target for biobehavioral
              interventions aimed at reducing motion sickness severity.",

               such as capacity mechanisms -- shape the future of the
               electricity markets. This transition towards a competitive and

  abstract  = "It is now believed that the universe is made of 69 \% dark
               energy, 27 \% dark matter, and 1 \% normal matter. All that we
               can see in the sky is the part of normal matter that is in the
               plasma state, emitting radiation. Plasma in physics, not to be
               confused with blood plasma, is an ``ionized'' gas in which at
               least one of the electrons in an atom has been stripped free,
               leaving a positively charged nucleus, called an ion. Sometimes
               plasma is called the ``fourth state of matter.'' When a solid is
               heated, it becomes a liquid. Heating a liquid turns it into a
               gas. Upon further heating, the gas is ionized into a plasma.
               Since a plasma is made of ions and electrons, which are charged,
               electric fields are rampant everywhere, and particles
               ``collide'' not just when they bump into one another, but even
               at a distance where they can feel their electric fields.
               Hydrodynamics, which describes the flow of water through pipes,
               say, or the flow around boats in yacht races, or the behavior of

              synaptic plasticity, but the cellular mechanisms are unknown. We
              report that interneurons of the mouse basal amygdala are
              activated during theta network activity or optogenetic
              stimulation of ventral CA1 pyramidal cell axons, whereas
              principal neurons are inhibited. Interneurons provide feedforward

              However, synaptic inhibition attenuates during theta frequency
              stimulation of ventral CA1 fibers, and this broadens excitatory
              postsynaptic potentials. These effects are mediated by GABAB
              receptors and change in the Cl(-) driving force. Pairing theta
              frequency stimulation of ventral CA1 fibers with coincident
              stimuli of the lateral amygdala induces long-term potentiation of

  abstract = "Gamma is a ubiquitous brain rhythm hypothesized to support
              cognitive, perceptual, and mnemonic functions by coordinating
              neuronal interactions. While much correlational evidence supports
              this hypothesis, direct experimental tests have been lacking.
              Since gamma occurs as brief bursts of varying frequencies and
              durations, most existing approaches to manipulate gamma are
              either too slow, delivered irrespective of the rhythm's presence,
              not spectrally specific, or unsuitable for bidirectional
              modulation. Here, we overcome these limitations with an approach
              that accurately detects and modulates endogenous gamma
              oscillations, using closed-loop signal processing and optogenetic
              stimulation. We first show that the rat basolateral amygdala

  author   = "Ahlgrim, Nathan S and Manns, Joseph R",
  abstract = "The amygdala can modulate declarative memory. For example,
              previous research in rats and humans showed that brief electrical
              stimulation to the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA)
              prioritized specific objects to be consolidated into long term
              memory in the absence of emotional stimuli and without awareness
              of stimulation. The capacity of the BLA to influence memory
              depends on its substantial projections to many other brain
              regions, including the hippocampus. Nevertheless, how activation
              of the BLA influences ongoing neuronal activity in other regions
              is poorly understood. The current study used optogenetic
              stimulation of putative glutamatergic neurons in the BLA of
              freely exploring rats to determine whether brief activation of
              the BLA could increase in the hippocampus gamma oscillations for
              which the amplitude was modulated by the phase of theta
              oscillations, an oscillatory state previously reported to
              correlate with good memory. BLA neurons were stimulated in 1-s
              bouts with pulse frequencies that included the theta range (8
              Hz), the gamma range (50 Hz), or a combination of both ranges
              (eight 50-Hz bursts). Local field potentials were recorded in the
              BLA and in the pyramidal layer of CA1 in the intermediate
              hippocampus. A key question was whether BLA stimulation at either
              theta or gamma frequencies could combine with ongoing hippocampal
              oscillations to result in theta-modulated gamma or whether BLA
              stimulation that included both theta and gamma frequencies would
              be necessary to increase theta-gamma comodulation in the
              hippocampus. All stimulation conditions elicited robust responses
              in BLA and CA1, but theta-modulated gamma oscillations increased
              in CA1 only when BLA stimulation included both theta and gamma
              frequencies. Longer bouts (5-s) of BLA stimulation resulted in
              hippocampal activity that evolved away from the initial
              oscillatory states and toward those characterized more by
              prominent low-frequency oscillations. The current results
              indicated that one mechanism by which the amygdala might
              influence declarative memory is by eliciting neuronal oscillatory
              states in the hippocampus that benefit memory.",

              in response to fornix and hippocampal stimulation were collected
              with the implanted device and analyzed off-line. RESULTS:
              Stimulation of the fornix produced robust, short latency
              hippocampal EPs. High frequency fornix stimulation generated
              parameter-dependent effects. At low amplitudes, short lasting
              inhibition of LFP activity occurred. Above a specific amplitude
              threshold, DBS elicited pronounced bursts of theta activity,
              followed by a marked state shift in hippocampal activity. These
              effects persisted for minutes post-DBS and were reflected as
              changes in LFP spectral content and phase-amplitude coupling.
              Real-time modulation of hippocampal activity via the implanted
              device was demonstrated using LFPs as the control signal for
              closed-loop stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The current results expand
              earlier findings and demonstrate target-specific effects produced
              by DBS within this neural circuit. These changes in network
              activity may provide insights into stimulation targets and
              parameter selection for clinical investigations.",

  abstract = "The aim of this study is to examine how the amygdala and
              hippocampus interact for behavioral performance modulated by
              different Reward-expectations (REs). We simultaneously recorded
              neuronal spikes and local field potential from the basolateral
              amygdala and hippocampal CA1 while rats were performing a
              light-side discrimination task with different expectations of a
              high or low probability of reward delivery. Here, we report the
              following results. First, the rats actually modulated their
              behavioral performance on their expectations of a high or low
              probability of reward. Second, we found more neurons related to
              RE in the amygdala and more neurons related to task performance
              in the hippocampus. Third, a prominent increase in the coherence
              of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (90-150 Hz) between the
              amygdala and the hippocampus was present during high RE. Fourth,
              coherent HFOs during inter-trial intervals and theta coherence
              during trials had significant correlations with the behavioral
              goal-selection time. Finally, cross-frequency couplings of LFPs
              within and across the amygdala and hippocampus occurred during
              ITI. These results suggest that the amygdala and hippocampus have
              different functional roles in the present task with different
              REs, and the distinctive band of coherence between the amygdala
              and the hippocampus contributes to behavioral modulation on the

              through coherent oscillation, which is a part of the mechanism of

  abstract = "Despite the best available medical treatments, many patients
              continue to be disabled by neurologic and psychiatric disorders,
              resulting in a large unmet need. Advances in imaging and
              neurophysiology over the last two decades have led to a
              reinterpretation of some neurologic and psychiatric conditions as
              primarily disorders of circuit function, or ``circuitopathies.''
              These developments have been accompanied by advances in
              neurosurgical techniques with the increasingly widespread
              utilization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to recalibrate
              dysfunctional circuits. The versatility of DBS as both a probe
              and modulator of neural circuits is making it a powerful tool to
              study the human brain, helping provide important details of the
              pathophysiology of circuit dysfunction. We are currently in a
              phase of active investigation to determine which circuits and
              disorders could be treated with DBS. Here we review recent
              advances in the DBS field and discuss potential future directions

              the symptoms of selected neurological disorders by modulating
              activity within dysfunctional brain circuits. To date, there is
              no evidence that DBS counteracts progressive neurodegeneration in
              any particular disorder. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized
              that DBS applied to the fornix in patients with Alzheimer's
              Disease (AD) could have an effect on brain structure. METHODS: In
              six AD patients receiving fornix DBS, we used structural MRI to
              assess one-year change in hippocampal, fornix, and mammillary
              body volume. We also used deformation-based morphometry to
              identify whole-brain structural changes. We correlated volumetric
              changes to hippocampal glucose metabolism. We also compared
              volumetric changes to those in an age-, sex-, and
              severity-matched group of AD patients (n = 25) not receiving DBS.
              RESULTS: We observed bilateral hippocampal volume increases in
              the two patients with the best clinical response to fornix DBS.
              In one patient, hippocampal volume was preserved three years
              after diagnosis. Overall, mean hippocampal atrophy was
              significantly slower in the DBS group compared to the matched AD
              group, and no matched AD patients demonstrated bilateral
              hippocampal enlargement. Across DBS patients, hippocampal volume
              change correlated strongly with hippocampal metabolism and with
              volume change in the fornix and mammillary bodies, suggesting a
              circuit-wide effect of stimulation. Deformation-based morphometry
              in DBS patients revealed local volume expansions in several
              regions typically atrophied in AD. CONCLUSION: We present the

              implanted electrodes can causally reveal structural connectivity
              by eliciting cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). While
              many studies have demonstrated the potential value of CCEPs, the
              methods to evaluate them were often relatively subjective, did
              not consider potential artifacts, and did not lend themselves to
              systematic scientific investigations. NEW METHOD: We developed an
              automated and quantitative method called SIGNI
              (Stimulation-Induced Gamma-based Network Identification) to
              evaluate cortical population-level responses to electrical
              stimulation that minimizes the impact of electrical artifacts. We
              applied SIGNI to electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from eight
              human subjects who were implanted with a total of 978 subdural
              electrodes. Across the eight subjects, we delivered 92 trains of
              approximately 200 discrete electrical stimuli each (amplitude
              4-15 mA) to a total of 64 electrode pairs. RESULTS: We verified
              SIGNI's efficacy by demonstrating a relationship between the
              magnitude of evoked cortical activity and stimulation amplitude,
              as well as between the latency of evoked cortical activity and
              the distance from the stimulated locations. CONCLUSIONS: SIGNI
              reveals the timing and amplitude of cortical responses to
              electrical stimulation as well as the structural connectivity
              supporting these responses. With these properties, it enables
              exploration of new and important questions about the

              network is associated with Parkinsonian motor symptoms and is
              suppressed with medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The
              origins of the beta-band oscillations, however, remains unclear
              with both intrinsic oscillations arising within the subthalamic
              nucleus (STN)-external globus pallidus (GPe) network and
              exogenous beta-activity, originating outside the network,
              proposed as potential sources of the pathological activity. The
              aim of this study was to explore the relative contribution of
              autonomous oscillations and exogenous oscillatory inputs in the
              generation of pathological oscillatory activity in a
              biophysically detailed model of the parkinsonian STN-GPe network.
              The network model accounts for the integration of synaptic
              currents and their interaction with intrinsic membrane currents
              in dendritic structures within the STN and GPe. The model was
              used to investigate the development of beta-band synchrony and
              bursting within the STN-GPe network by changing the balance of
              excitation and inhibition in both nuclei, and by adding exogenous
              oscillatory inputs with varying phase relationships through the
              hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic and indirect striato-pallidal
              pathways. The model showed an intrinsic susceptibility to
              beta-band oscillations that was manifest in weak autonomously
              generated oscillations within the STN-GPe network and in
              selective amplification of exogenous beta-band synaptic inputs
              near the network's endogenous oscillation frequency. The
              frequency at which this resonance peak occurred was determined by
              the net level of excitatory drive to the network. Intrinsic or
              endogenously generated oscillations were too weak to support a
              pacemaker role for the STN-GPe network, however, they were
              considerably amplified by sparse cortical beta inputs and were
              further amplified by striatal beta inputs that promoted
              anti-phase firing of the cortex and GPe, resulting in maximum
              transient inhibition of STN neurons. The model elucidates a
              mechanism of cortical patterning of the STN-GPe network through
              feedback inhibition whereby intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band
              oscillations can lead to phase locked spiking under parkinsonian
              conditions. These results point to resonance of endogenous
              oscillations with exogenous patterning of the STN-GPe network as
              a mechanism of pathological synchronization, and a role for the
              pallido-striatal feedback loop in amplifying beta oscillations.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) are
              utilized to identify effective networks in the human brain.
              Following single-pulse electrical stimulation of cortical
              electrodes, evoked responses are recorded from distant cortical
              areas. A negative deflection (N1) which occurs 10-50 ​ms
              post-stimulus is considered to be a marker for direct
              cortico-cortical connectivity. However, with CCEPs alone it is
              not possible to observe the white matter pathways that conduct
              the signal or accurately predict N1 amplitude and latency at
              downstream recoding sites. Here, we develop a new approach,
              termed ``dynamic tractography,'' which integrates CCEP data with
              diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data collected from the same
              patients. This innovative method allows greater insights into
              cortico-cortical networks than provided by each method alone and
              may improve the understanding of large-scale networks that
              support cognitive functions. The dynamic tractography model
              produces several fundamental hypotheses which we investigate: 1)
              DWI-based pathlength predicts N1 latency; 2) DWI-based pathlength
              negatively predicts N1 voltage; and 3) fractional anisotropy (FA)
              along the white matter path predicts N1 propagation velocity.
              METHODS: Twenty-three neurosurgical patients with drug-resistant
              epilepsy underwent both extraoperative CCEP recordings and
              preoperative DWI scans. Subdural grids of 3 ​mm diameter
              electrodes were used for stimulation and recording, with 98-128
              eligible electrodes per patient. CCEPs were elicited by trains of
              1 ​Hz stimuli with an intensity of 5 ​mA and recorded at a sample
              rate of 1 ​kHz. N1 peak and latency were defined as the maximum
              of a negative deflection within 10-50 ​ms post-stimulus with a
              z-score > 5 relative to baseline. Electrodes and DWI were
              coregistered to construct electrode connectomes for white matter
              quantification. RESULTS: Clinical variables (age, sex, number of
              anti-epileptic drugs, handedness, and stimulated hemisphere) did
              not correlate with the key outcome measures (N1 peak amplitude,
              latency, velocity, or DWI pathlength). All subjects and
              electrodes were therefore pooled into a group-level analysis to
              determine overall patterns. As hypothesized, DWI path length
              positively predicted N1 latency (R2 ​= ​0.81, $\beta$ ​= ​1.51, p
              ​= ​4.76e-16) and negatively predicted N1 voltage (R2 ​= ​0.79,
              $\beta$ ​= ​-0.094, p ​= ​9.30e-15), while FA predicted N1
              propagation velocity (R2 ​= ​0.35, $\beta$ ​= ​48.0, p ​=
              ​0.001). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the strength and
              timing of the CCEP N1 is dependent on the properties of the
              underlying white matter network. Integrated CCEP and DWI

              were conducted with a sample of 50 healthy university students,
              between the ages of 18 and 28 years, which included equivalent
              distributions of men and women from ethnically diverse

                   Human interaction with autonomous systems is broadly
                   studied, but research has hitherto under-explored
                   interactions that occur while the system is actively

                   minutes. In this pilot study, we investigate how the
                   interaction between a human and a continually learning
                   prediction agent develops as the agent develops competency.
                   Additionally, we compare two different agent architectures
                   to assess how representational choices in agent design
                   affect the human-agent interaction. We develop a virtual

                   learned predictions from a reinforcement learning (RL)
                   algorithm augment human predictions. We assess how a
                   participant's performance and behaviour in this task differs
                   across agent types, using both quantitative and qualitative
                   analyses. Our findings suggest that human trust of the
                   system may be influenced by early interactions with the

              extensively studied in freely moving rodents, its presence in
              humans has been elusive and primarily investigated in stationary

              theta within the human MTL during untethered, real-world
              ambulatory movement. We recorded intracranial
              electroencephalographic activity from participants chronically
              implanted with the wireless NeuroPace responsive neurostimulator

              manner. To do so, expected, predictable features are
              differentiated from unexpected ones by comparing bottom-up and
              top-down streams of data. It is theorized that the neocortex then
              changes the representation of incoming stimuli, guided by
              differences in the responses to expected and unexpected events.
              Such differences in cortical responses have been observed;
              however, it remains unknown whether these unexpected event
              signals govern subsequent changes in the brain's stimulus
              representations, and, thus, govern learning. Here, we show that
              unexpected event signals predict subsequent changes in responses
              to expected and unexpected stimuli in individual neurons and
              distal apical dendrites that are tracked over a period of days.
              These findings were obtained by observing layer 2/3 and layer 5
              pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex of awake, behaving
              mice using two-photon calcium imaging. We found that many neurons
              in both layers 2/3 and 5 showed large differences between their
              responses to expected and unexpected events. These unexpected
              event signals also determined how the responses evolved over
              subsequent days, in a manner that was different between the
              somata and distal apical dendrites. This difference between the
              somata and distal apical dendrites may be important for
              hierarchical computation, given that these two compartments tend
              to receive bottom-up and top-down information, respectively.
              Together, our results provide novel evidence that the neocortex

              Second, RNNs perform inference by learning a two-dimensional
              subspace defining beliefs about the latent variables. Third, the
              geometry of RNN dynamics reflects an induced coupling between the

              feedforward and feedback connections. Here, we train a 2-layered
              SDPC on two different databases of images, and we interpret it as
              a model of the early visual system (V1 \& V2). We first
              demonstrate that once the training has converged, SDPC exhibits
              oriented and localized receptive fields in V1 and more complex
              features in V2. Second, we analyze the effects of feedback on the
              neural organization beyond the classical receptive field of V1
              neurons using interaction maps. These maps are similar to
              association fields and reflect the Gestalt principle of good
              continuation. We demonstrate that feedback signals reorganize
              interaction maps and modulate neural activity to promote contour
              integration. Third, we demonstrate at the representational level
              that the SDPC feedback connections are able to overcome noise in
              input images. Therefore, the SDPC captures the association field
              principle at the neural level which results in a better

              presumed to reflect the final stages of planning and preparation

              premovement buildup. We used a leaky stochastic accumulator to
              model the neural decision of ``when'' to move in a task where
              there is no specific temporal cue, but only a general imperative
              to produce a movement after an unspecified delay on the order of
              several seconds. According to our model, when the imperative to
              produce a movement is weak, the precise moment at which the
              decision threshold is crossed leading to movement is largely
              determined by spontaneous subthreshold fluctuations in neuronal

  abstract = "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a deeply enigmatic
              psychiatric condition associated with immense suffering
              worldwide. Efficacious therapies for OCD, like exposure and
              response prevention (ERP), are sometimes poorly tolerated by
              patients. As many as 25\% of patients refuse to initiate ERP
              mainly because they are too anxious to follow exposure
              procedures. Accordingly, we proposed a simple and tolerable
              (immersive yet indirect) low-cost technique for treating OCD that
              we call ``multisensory stimulation therapy.'' This method
              involves contaminating a rubber hand during the so-called
              ``rubber hand illusion'' (RHI) in which tactile sensations may be
              perceived as arising from a fake hand. Notably, Jalal et al.
              (2015) showed that such fake hand contamination during the RHI
              provokes powerful disgust reactions in healthy volunteers. In the
              current study, we explored the therapeutic potential of this
              novel approach. OCD patients (n = 29) watched as their hidden
              real hand was being stroked together with a visible fake hand;
              either synchronously (inducing the RHI; i.e., the experimental
              condition; n = 16) or asynchronously (i.e., the control
              condition; n = 13). After 5 min of tactile stimulation, the
              rubber hand was contaminated with fake feces, simulating
              conventional exposure therapy. Intriguingly, results suggested
              sensory assimilation of contamination sensations into the body
              image via the RHI: patients undergoing synchronous stimulation
              did not report greater contamination sensations when the fake
              hand was initially contaminated relative to asynchronous
              stroking. But contrary to expectations, they did so after the
              rubber hand had been contaminated for 5 min, as assessed via
              disgust facial expressions (a secondary outcome) and in vivo
              exposure (upon discontinuing the illusion). Further, to our
              surprise, synchronous and asynchronous stroking induced an
              equally vivid and fast-emerging illusion, which helps explain why
              both conditions initially (5 min after initiating tactile
              stimulation) provoked contamination reactions of equal magnitude.
              This study is the first to suggest heightened malleability of
              body image in OCD. Importantly, it may pave the way for a
              tolerable technique for the treatment of OCD-highly suitable for
              poorly resourced and emergency settings, including low-income and

              challenge of identifying a robust, high bandwidth sensory
              encoding scheme in a high-dimensional parameter space. Previous
              studies demonstrated single dimensional encoding schemes

              has been performed across parameters, nor with update rates

              key stimulation parameters such as pulse amplitude, pulse width,
              frequency, train interval and number of pulses. Surprisingly,
              modulation of stimulation frequency was largely undetectable.
              While we initially expected high frequency content to be an ideal

               social communication and language comprehension [1--5]. However,
               it is debated whether mental imagery relies on the same sensory
               representations as perception [1, 6--10], and if so, what
               functional consequences such an overlap might have on perception
               itself. We report novel evidence that single instances of
               imagery can have a pronounced facilitatory influence on
               subsequent conscious perception. Either seeing or imagining a
               specific pattern could strongly bias which of two competing
               stimuli reach awareness during binocular rivalry. Effects of

              However, the multisensory-integration process in VR is not yet

              hyperdirect pathway. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that DBS would
              reduce the current intensity necessary to modulate motor-evoked
              potentials from focally applied direct cortical stimulation
              (DCS). METHODS: Intraoperative subthalamic DBS, DCS, and
              preoperative diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired in 8
              patients with Parkinson's disease. RESULTS: In 7 of 8 patients,
              DBS significantly reduced the M1 DCS current intensity required
              to elicit motor-evoked potentials. This neuromodulation was
              specific to select DBS bipolar configurations. In addition, the
              volume of activated tissue models of these configurations were
              significantly associated with overlap of the hyperdirect pathway.
              CONCLUSIONS: DBS reduces the current necessary to elicit a
              motor-evoked potential using DCS. This supports a circuit
              mechanism of DBS effectiveness, potentially involving the
              hyperdirect pathway that speculatively may underlie reductions in
              hypokinetic abnormalities in Parkinson's disease. \copyright{}

               research is increasing because they allow to controllably model

               was previously demonstrated that the rubber hand illusion may be

  abstract = "The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is one of the most commonly used
              paradigms to examine the sense of body ownership. Touches are
              synchronously applied to the real hand, hidden from view, and a
              false hand in an anatomically congruent position. During the
              illusion one may perceive that the feeling of touch arises from
              the false hand (referral of touch), and that the false hand is
              one's own. The relationship between referral of touch and body
              ownership in the illusion is unclear, and some articles average
              responses to statements addressing these experiences, which may
              be inappropriate depending on the research question of interest.
              To address these concerns, we re-analyzed three freely available
              datasets to better understand the relationship between referral
              of touch and feeling of ownership in the RHI. We found that most
              participants who report a feeling of ownership also report
              referral of touch, and that referral of touch and ownership show
              a moderately strong positive relationship that was highly
              replicable. In addition, referral of touch tends to be reported
              more strongly and more frequently than the feeling of ownership
              over the hand. The former observations confirm that referral of
              touch and ownership are related experiences in the RHI. The
              latter, however, indicate that when pooling the statements one
              may obtain a higher number of illusion 'responders' compared to
              considering the ownership statements in isolation. These results

              scientific and clinical tool, causally testing hypotheses and
              treating neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.
              However, current stimulation approaches cannot flexibly control
              the pattern of activity in populations of neurons. To address
              this, we developed an adaptive, closed-loop stimulation (ACLS)
              system that uses patterned, multi-site electrical stimulation to
              control the pattern of activity in a population of neurons.
              Importantly, ACLS is a learning system; it monitors the response
              to stimulation and iteratively updates the stimulation pattern to
              produce a specific neural response. In silico and in vivo
              experiments showed ACLS quickly learns to produce specific
              patterns of neural activity (∼15 minutes) and was robust to noise
              and drift in neural responses. In visual cortex of awake mice,
              ACLS learned electrical stimulation patterns that produced
              responses similar to the natural response evoked by visual
              stimuli. Similar to how repetition of a visual stimulus causes an
              adaptation in the neural response, the response to electrical
              stimulation was adapted when it was preceded by the associated
              visual stimulus. Altogether, our results show ACLS can learn, in
              real-time, to generate specific patterns of neural activity,
              providing a framework for using closed-loop learning to control

               provides high degree of freedom, it is been used for many
               real-time applications, especially for locked-in people. The
               available BCIs using MI-based EEG signals usually makes use of
               spatial filtering and powerful classification methods to attain
               better accuracy and performance. Inter-subject variability and
               speed of the classifier is still a issue in MI-based BCIs. To
               address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a
               new classification method, spatial filtering based sparsity
               (SFS) approach for MI-based BCIs. The proposed method makes use
               of common spatial pattern (CSP) to spatially filter the MI
               signals. Then frequency bandpower and wavelet features from the
               spatially filtered signals are used to bulid two different

               overcome the issue of inter-subject variability. Later, sparse

              of such flexibility, we recorded from the medial frontal cortex
              of nonhuman primates trained to produce different time intervals
              with different effectors. Neural responses were heterogeneous,
              nonlinear, and complex, and they exhibited a remarkable form of
              temporal invariance: firing rate profiles were temporally scaled
              to match the produced intervals. Recording from downstream
              neurons in the caudate and from thalamic neurons projecting to
              the medial frontal cortex indicated that this phenomenon
              originates within cortical networks. Recurrent neural network

  abstract = "To coordinate movements with events in a dynamic environment the
              brain has to anticipate when those events occur. A classic
              example is the estimation of time to contact (TTC), that is, when
              an object reaches a target. It is thought that TTC is estimated
              from kinematic variables. For example, a tennis player might use
              an estimate of distance (d) and speed (v) to estimate TTC (TTC =
              d/v). However, the tennis player may instead estimate TTC as
              twice the time it takes for the ball to move from the serve line
              to the net line. This latter strategy does not rely on kinematics
              and instead computes TTC solely from temporal cues. Which of
              these two strategies do humans use to estimate TTC? Considering
              that both speed and time estimates are inherently uncertain and
              the ability of the human brain to combine different sources of
              information, we hypothesized that humans estimate TTC by
              integrating speed information with temporal cues. We evaluated
              this hypothesis systematically using psychophysics and Bayesian

              information and temporal cues and integrate them to optimize
              their TTC estimates when both cues are present. These findings

              revealed a hippocampus->prefrontal cortex directionality of
              information flow at theta frequency, peaking at starting areas of
              the maze, and on the reverse direction at delta frequency,
              peaking near the turn onset. Additionally, the patterns of
              phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling within and between the
              regions also showed spatial selectivity, and a new method
              revealed that hippocampal theta and prefrontal delta modulated

              strengthening key motor pathways thought to support motor

              purpose of this study was to combine the principles of VR and BCI

              chronic stroke patients across different levels of motor

              survivors across a wide range of motor disabilities. Finally,

              (LDA) are commonly used due to simplicity and robustness.
              However, LDA is inherently static and not suited to account for
              transient information that is typically present in high-gamma
              features. To resolve this issue, we here present an extension of
              LDA to the time-variant feature space. We call this method
              time-variant linear discriminant analysis (TVLDA). It
              intrinsically provides a feature reduction stage, which makes
              external approaches thereto obsolete, such as feature selection
              techniques or common spatial patterns (CSPs). As well, we propose
              a time-domain whitening stage which equalizes the pronounced
              1/f-shape of the typical brain-wave spectrum. We evaluated our
              proposed architecture based on recordings from 15 epilepsy
              patients with temporarily implanted subdural grids, who
              participated in additional research experiments besides clinical
              treatment. The experiments featured two different motor tasks
              involving three high-level gestures and individual finger
              movement. We used log-transformed bandpower features from the
              high-gamma band (50-300 Hz, excluding power-line harmonics) for
              classification. On average, whitening improved the classification
              performance by about 11\%. On whitened data, TVLDA outperformed
              LDA with feature selection by 11.8\%, LDA with CSPs by 13.9\%,
              and regularized LDA with vectorized features by 16.4\%. At the
              same time, TVLDA only required one or two internal features to
              achieve this. TVLDA provides stable results even if very few
              trials are available. It is easy to implement, fully automatic
              and deterministic. Due to its low complexity, TVLDA is suited for
              real-time brain-computer interfaces. Training is done in less
              than a second. TVLDA performed particularly well in experiments
              with data from high-density electrode arrays. For example, the

                   number of simulated trials and the difference between the

                   excellent recovery of the mixture, intermediate, and outside

              accounts of autistic perception can be augmented by considering a
              role for individual differences in top-down expectations for the
              precision of sensory input, related to the processing of
              state-dependent levels of uncertainty. We therefore examined
              ASD-like traits in relation to the rubber-hand illusion: an
              experimental paradigm that typically elicits crossmodal
              integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information in
              an unusual illusory context. Individuals with higher ASD-like
              traits showed reduced effects of the rubber-hand illusion on
              perceived arm position and reach-to-grasp movements, compared to
              individuals with lower ASD-like traits. These differences

              experience of the illusion concerning visuotactile integration
              and ownership for the rubber hand. Together these results suggest
              that the integration of proprioceptive information with cues for
              arm position derived from the illusory context differs between
              individuals partly in relation to traits associated with ASD. We
              suggest that the observed differences in sensory integration can

              for any body part used as an effector? To address this question,
              we conducted a neuroimaging study with people born without upper
              limbs-individuals with dysplasia-who use the feet to act, as they
              and typically developed controls performed reaching and grasping
              actions with their dominant effector. Individuals with dysplasia
              have no prior experience acting with hands, allowing us to
              control for hand motor imagery when acting with another effector
              (i.e., foot). Primary sensorimotor cortices showed selectivity
              for the hand in controls and foot in individuals with dysplasia.
              Importantly, we found a preference based on action type
              (reaching/grasping) regardless of the effector used in the
              association sensorimotor cortex, in the left intraparietal sulcus

              Intermediate areas along a posterior-anterior gradient in the

              selectivity based on the body part to selectivity based on the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Hand movement is a crucial function for humans' daily
              life. Developing brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a
              robotic hand by brain signals would help the severely paralyzed
              people partially regain the functional independence. Previous
              intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)-based BMIs towards
              gesture decoding mostly used neural signals from the primary
              sensorimotor cortex while ignoring the hand movement related
              signals from posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Here, we propose
              combining iEEG recordings from PPC with that from primary
              sensorimotor cortex to enhance the gesture decoding performance
              of iEEG-based BMI. APPROACH: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG)
              signals from 25 epilepsy subjects were recorded when they
              performed a three-class hand gesture task. Across all 25
              subjects, we identified 524, 114 and 221 electrodes from three
              regions of interest (ROIs), including PPC, postcentral cortex
              (POC) and precentral cortex (PRC), respectively. Based on the
              time-varying high gamma power (55-150 Hz) of SEEG signal, both
              the general activation in the task and the fine selectivity to
              gestures of each electrode in these ROIs along time was evaluated
              by the coefficient of determination r 2. According to the
              activation along time, we further assessed the first activation
              time of each ROI. Finally, the decoding accuracy for gestures was
              obtained by linear support vector machine classifier to
              comparatively explore if the PPC will assist PRC and POC for
              gesture decoding. MAIN RESULTS: We find that a majority(L:
              [Formula: see text] 60\%, R: [Formula: see text] 40\%) of
              electrodes in all the three ROIs present significant activation
              during the task. A large scale temporal activation sequence
              exists among the ROIs, where PPC activates first, PRC second and
              POC last. Among the activated electrodes, 15\% (PRC), 26\% (POC)
              and 4\% (left PPC) of electrodes are significantly selective to
              gestures. Moreover, decoding accuracy obtained by combining the
              selective electrodes from three ROIs together is 5\%, 3.6\%, and
              8\% higher than that from only PRC and POC when decoding features
              across, before, and after the movement onset, were used.
              SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first human iEEG study demonstrating
              that PPC contains neural information about fine hand movement,
              supporting the role of PPC in hand shape encoding. Combining PPC
              with primary sensorimotor cortex can provide more information to
              improve the gesture decoding performance. Our results suggest
              that PPC could be a rich neural source for iEEG-based BMI. Our
              findings also demonstrate the early involvement of human PPC in
              visuomotor task and thus may provide additional implications for
              further scientific research and BMI applications.",

              powered on (VR-on). Within the same session, EEG were collected

              both conditions associated with decreases in alpha and beta power

              cortex using ECoG electrodes for direct electrical stimulation

              bidirectional BCI, where information is both read from and

              information about obstacles in a virtual maze. At certain

              participants, the wide adoption of the illusion has led to a

              with that, considerable apparent inconsistencies in both

              modalities plays a key role in bodily self-perception. When
              visual information is used in the multisensory process of
              localizing and identifying one's own limbs, the sight of a body
              part often plays a dominant role. For example, it has repeatedly
              been shown that a viewed object must resemble a humanoid body
              part to permit illusory self-attribution of that object. Here, we
              report a perceptual illusion that challenges these assumptions by
              demonstrating that healthy (nonamputated) individuals can refer
              somatic sensations to a discrete volume of empty space and
              experience having an invisible hand. In 10 behavioral and one
              fMRI experiment, we characterized the perceptual rules and
              multisensory brain mechanisms that produced this ``invisible hand
              illusion.'' Our behavioral results showed that the illusion
              depends on visuotactile-proprioceptive integration that obeys key
              spatial and temporal multisensory rules confined to near-personal
              space. The fMRI results associate the illusion experience with
              increased activity in regions related to the integration of
              multisensory body-related signals, most notably the bilateral
              ventral premotor, intraparietal, and cerebellar cortices. We
              further showed that a stronger feeling of having an invisible
              hand is associated with a higher degree of effective connectivity
              between the intraparietal and ventral premotor cortices. These

              three-dimensional experiences that ``transport'' users to novel
              environments. Because VR is effective for acute pain and anxiety,
              it may have benefits for hospitalized patients; however, there
              are few reports using VR in this setting. OBJECTIVE: The aim was
              to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of VR in a diverse
              cohort of hospitalized patients. METHODS: We assessed the
              acceptability and feasibility of VR in a cohort of patients
              admitted to an inpatient hospitalist service over a 4-month
              period. We excluded patients with motion sickness, stroke,
              seizure, dementia, nausea, and in isolation. Eligible patients
              viewed VR experiences (eg, ocean exploration; Cirque du Soleil;
              tour of Iceland) with Samsung Gear VR goggles. We then conducted
              semistructured patient interview and performed statistical
              testing to compare patients willing versus unwilling to use VR.
              RESULTS: We evaluated 510 patients; 423 were excluded and 57
              refused to participate, leaving 30 participants. Patients willing
              versus unwilling to use VR were younger (mean 49.1, SD 17.4 years
              vs mean 60.2, SD 17.7 years; P=.01); there were no differences by
              sex, race, or ethnicity. Among users, most reported a positive
              experience and indicated that VR could improve pain and anxiety,
              although many felt the goggles were uncomfortable. CONCLUSIONS:
              Most inpatient users of VR described the experience as pleasant
              and capable of reducing pain and anxiety. However, few
              hospitalized patients in this ``real-world'' series were both
              eligible and willing to use VR. Consistent with the ``digital

              physiological sensations related to anxiety. Patients and
              caregivers in the VR condition reported high levels of
              satisfaction with the procedure. Conclusion: VR is feasible,
              tolerated, and well-liked by patients, caregivers, and
              phlebotomists alike for routine blood draw. Given the immersive
              and engaging nature of the VR experience, VR has the capacity to
              act as a preventive intervention transforming the blood draw
              experience into a less distressing, potentially pain-free routine
              medical procedure, particularly for pediatric patients with high
              anxiety sensitivity. VR holds promise to reduce negative health
              outcomes for children and reduce distress in caregivers, while
              facilitating increased satisfaction and throughput in hectic
              outpatient phlebotomy clinics.",

              for recording of slow EEG potentials. METHODS: Experiments were
              carried out on six types of reusable electrodes (silver, tin and
              gold cup electrodes, sintered silver-silver chloride (Ag|AgCl),
              platinum, stainless steel), six disposable Ag|AgCl electrode
              models, and nine gels or pastes. We studied the parameters, which
              are critical in slow-potential recording, such as polarization,
              initial and long-term stability and low-frequency noise. RESULTS:
              The best results were obtained with the reusable sintered Ag|AgCl
              electrodes. The six disposable Ag|AgCl electrode models also
              proved to have appropriate electrical properties. Other types of
              reusable electrodes suffered from diverse degrees of
              polarization, baseline drift, low-frequency noise, high
              resistance, and changes in properties due to wear and tear. Seven
              out of nine gels or pastes contained a significant amount of
              chloride, which is a prerequisite for DC stability of Ag|AgCl
              electrodes, whereas the absolute concentration of chloride had
              little effect. CONCLUSIONS: Direct current (DC) coupled recording
              of EEG is critically dependent on the choice of electrode and

               which refers to the reference object that remains fixed in
               position with respect to the user. A popular choice of the rest

              spectral dynamics of directional LFPs in subthalamic nucleus
              (STN) and their relationship to motor symptoms of Parkinson's
              disease (PD). Methods: We recorded intraoperative STN-LFPs from
              8-contact leads (Infinity-6172, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois,
              United States) in 8 PD patients at rest. Directional LFPs were
              referenced to their common average and time-frequency analysis
              was computed using a modified Welch periodogram method. The beta
              band (13-35 Hz) features were extracted and their correlation to
              preoperative UPDRS-III scores were assessed. Results: Normalized

              found to be higher in anterior direction despite lack of

              Tremor and 7 Parkinson's Disease) implanted with directional DBS
              electrodes in the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) were
              enrolled. Side-effect thresholds of monopolar directional
              stimulation (DIRECT) were compared to circular DBS as well as, in
              a randomized design, to those of two different bipolar
              stimulation settings (BIPOLAR = circular anode; BI-DIRECT =
              directional anode). Tremor suppression (Tremor Rating Scale, TRS)
              right below the side-effect threshold was also assessed. RESULTS:
              Directional DBS in the individually best direction showed higher
              side-effect thresholds than circular DBS (p = 0.0063). The
              thresholds were raised further using either one of the bipolar
              stimulation paradigms (BIPOLAR p = 0.0029, BI-DIRECT p = 0.0022).
              The side-effect thresholds did not differ between both bipolar
              settings, but side-effects were less frequent with BI-DIRECT. No
              difference in TRS scores with stimulation just below the
              side-effect threshold was found between all stimulation
              conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Side-effect thresholds of monopolar
              directional and bipolar stimulation with both circular and
              directional anodes were higher compared to traditional monopolar
              circular stimulation in the VIM. Bipolar DBS with directional
              anodes evoked side-effect less frequently than bipolar and

              comparable effects on tremor suppression just below their
              side-effect thresholds. Thus, directional and different bipolar

              side-effects of thalamic stimulation when monopolar stimulation

              valid therapy for a variety of pathological conditions ranging
              from motor to cognitive disorders. Still, much of the DBS-related
              mechanism of action is far from being understood, and there are
              several side effects of DBS whose origin is unclear. In the last
              years DBS limitations have been tackled by a variety of
              approaches, including adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), a
              technique that relies on using chronically implanted electrodes
              on 'sensing mode' to detect the neural markers of specific motor
              symptoms and to deliver on-demand or modulate the stimulation
              parameters accordingly. Here we will review the state of the art
              of the several approaches to improve DBS and summarize the main
              challenges toward the development of an effective aDBS therapy.
              APPROACH: We discuss models of basal ganglia disorders
              pathogenesis, hardware and software improvements for conventional
              DBS, and candidate neural and non-neural features and related
              control strategies for aDBS. MAIN RESULTS: We identify then the
              main operative challenges toward optimal DBS such as (i) accurate
              target localization, (ii) increased spatial resolution of
              stimulation, (iii) development of in silico tests for DBS, (iv)
              identification of specific motor symptoms biomarkers, in
              particular (v) assessing how LFP oscillations relate to
              behavioral disfunctions, and (vi) clarify how stimulation affects
              the cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic network to (vii) design
              optimal stimulation patterns. SIGNIFICANCE: This roadmap will
              lead neural engineers novel to the field toward the most relevant
              open issues of DBS, while the in-depth readers might find a
              careful comparison of advantages and drawbacks of the most recent

              individual placement of the lead in relation to the target. The
              ability to generate axially asymmetric fields of stimulation
              translates into a broader therapeutic window (TW) compared to
              conventional DBS. However, changing the shape and surface of
              stimulating electrodes (directional segmented vs. conventional
              ring-shaped) also demands a revision of the programming
              strategies employed for DBS programming. Model-based approaches
              have been used to predict the shape of the VTA, which can be
              visualized on standardized neuroimaging atlases or individual
              magnetic resonance imaging. While potentially useful for
              optimizing clinical care, these systems remain limited by factors
              such as patient-specific anatomical variability, postsurgical
              lead migrations, and inability to account for individual contact
              impedances and orientation of the systems of fibers surrounding

              functional assessment of stimulation-induced clinical benefits
              and side effects allow one to collect and analyze data from each
              electrode of the DBS system and provide an action plan of ranked
              alternatives for therapeutic settings based on the selection of
              optimal directional contacts. Overall, an increasing amount of
              data supports the use of directional DBS. It is conceivable that
              the use of directionality may reduce the need for complex
              programming paradigms such as bipolar configurations, frequency
              or pulse width modulation, or interleaving. At a minimum,
              stimulation through directional electrodes can be considered as
              another tool to improve the benefit/side effect ratio. At a
              maximum, directionality may become the preferred way to program
              because of its larger TW and lower energy consumption.",

              elicited by subthalamic, thalamic, and pallidal deep brain
              stimulation (DBS) for movement disorders. METHODS: During DBS
              surgery, we delivered pairs of stimulus pulses with both circular
              and directional leads across 90 interstimulus intervals in 17
              participants and recorded local field potentials from unused
              contacts on the implanted electrode array. We removed the
              stimulus artifact, validated the neural origin of the underlying
              signals, and examined short-term plasticity as a function of
              interstimulus interval and DBS target, using linear mixed effects
              models. RESULTS: DBS evokes short latency local field potentials
              that are readily detected with both circular and directional
              leads at all stimulation targets (0.31 $\pm$ 0.10 msec peak
              latency, mean $\pm$ SD). Peak amplitude, area, and latency are
              modified strongly by interstimulus interval (P < 0.001) and
              display absolute and relative refractory periods (0.56 $\pm$ 0.08
              and 2.94 $\pm$ 1.05 msec, respectively). We also identified later
              oscillatory activity in the subthalamic-pallidal circuit (4.50
              $\pm$ 1.11 msec peak latency) that displays paired pulse
              facilitation (present in 5/8 subthalamic, 4/5 pallidal, and 0/6
              thalamic trajectories, P = 0.018, Fisher's exact test), and
              correlates with resting beta frequency power (P < 0.001),
              therapeutic DBS frequencies, and stimulation sites chosen later
              for therapy in the ambulatory setting (P = 0.031).
              INTERPRETATION: Paired DBS pulses synchronize local circuit
              electrophysiology and elicit short-term neuroplasticity in the
              subthalamic-pallidal circuit. Collectively, these responses
              likely represent the earliest detectable interaction between the
              DBS pulse and local neuronal tissue in humans. Evoked subcortical
              field potentials could serve as a predictive biomarker to guide
              the implementation of next-generation directional and adaptive

              between a visual and a haptic stimulus may be such that the
              stimuli are still perceived as being synchronous. Participants
              had to judge whether the moment at which a graphical object
              collided with a virtual wall occurred simultaneously with the
              moment at which a force was felt through a force feedback
              joystick. Participants either moved the joystick to drive the
              object (active touch) or held the joystick in a steady position
              while the object moved by itself (passive touch). Participants
              were found to be very sensitive to visual-haptic time delays.
              Sensitivity was higher for passive touch than for active touch.
              The minimum delay at which participants judged the stimuli as
              asynchronous was on average 45 ms. The delay at which the
              proportion of synchronous judgments reached a maximum was on
              average close to zero. The results indicate that the temporal

               large-scale atomistic modeling of complex materials with near
               first-principles accuracy. For molecular dynamics simulations,
               accurate energies and interatomic forces are a prerequisite, but
               training ANN potentials simultaneously on energies and forces
               from electronic structure calculations is computationally
               demanding. Here, we introduce an efficient alternative method
               for the training of ANN potentials on energy and force
               information, based on an extrapolation of the total energy via a
               Taylor expansion. By translating the force information to
               approximate energies, the quadratic scaling with the number of
               atoms exhibited by conventional force-training methods can be
               avoided, which enables the training on reference datasets
               containing complex atomic structures. We demonstrate for
               different materials systems, clusters of water molecules, bulk
               liquid water, and a lithium transition-metal oxide that the
               proposed force-training approach provides substantial
               improvements over schemes that train on energies only. Including
               force information for training reduces the size of the reference
               datasets required for ANN potential construction, increases the
               transferability of the potential, and generally improves the
               force prediction accuracy. For a set of water clusters, the
               Taylor-expansion approach achieves around 50\% of the force
               error improvement compared to the explicit training on all force
               components, at a much smaller computational cost. The
               alternative force-training approach thus simplifies the

               accurate energies and interatomic forces for diverse types of

                   encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from
                   which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we
                   conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a
                   bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic
                   encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by
                   allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of
                   a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target
                   word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment
                   explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation
                   performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art
                   phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French
                   translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that
                   the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our
                   intuition.",

  abstract = "Recurrent neural network (RNN) based autoencoders, trained in an
              unsupervised manner, have been widely used to generate
              fixed-dimensional vector representations or embeddings for
              varying length multivariate time series. These embeddings have
              been demonstrated to be useful for time series reconstruction,
              classification, and creation of health index (HI) curves of
              machines being used in industrial applications, based on which
              the remaining useful life (RUL) of machines can be estimated. In
              this study, we extend the traditional form of RNN autoencoders as
              a feature extractor for multivariate time series to a more
              general form in terms of arranging the order of input or output
              sequences and the hidden unit architecture. We apply the
              embeddings obtained by different variants of RNN autoencoders for
              a time series classification task and a machine RUL estimation
              problem using two publicly available datasets. A random research
              strategy is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of all
              variants for each task in order to give a fair comparison of the
              general performance among different variants over a large
              hyperparameter space, as well as the best performance that each
              variant can achieve compared with the best reported values in the
              literature. Our results show that traditional reversing the order
              of output time series while maintaining the order of input time
              series when training an RNN autoencoder does not show improved
              performance for the two studied cases. Thus, intentionally
              arranging the input or output order seems unnecessary for
              training the RNN autoencoder as a feature extractor of time
              series. We further observe that only the RNN architectures with
              gating mechanism can achieve the functionality of encoding for
              the time series, and none of the three common gated architectures
              we studied shows significantly and consistently improved
              performance compared to the others on the two studied cases.
              However, the bidirectional RNN autoencoders yield slightly better
              performance than their unidirectional counterparts.",

  abstract = "Neural oscillations are ubiquitous across recording methodologies
              and species, broadly associated with cognitive tasks, and
              amenable to computational modelling that investigates neural
              circuit generating mechanisms and neural population dynamics.
              Because of this, neural oscillations offer an exciting potential
              opportunity for linking theory, physiology and mechanisms of
              cognition. However, despite their prevalence, there are many
              concerns-new and old-about how our analysis assumptions are
              violated by known properties of field potential data. For
              investigations of neural oscillations to be properly interpreted,
              and ultimately developed into mechanistic theories, it is
              necessary to carefully consider the underlying assumptions of the
              methods we employ. Here, we discuss seven methodological
              considerations for analysing neural oscillations. The
              considerations are to (1) verify the presence of oscillations, as
              they may be absent; (2) validate oscillation band definitions, to
              address variable peak frequencies; (3) account for concurrent
              non-oscillatory aperiodic activity, which might otherwise
              confound measures; measure and account for (4) temporal
              variability and (5) waveform shape of neural oscillations, which
              are often bursty and/or nonsinusoidal, potentially leading to
              spurious results; (6) separate spatially overlapping rhythms,
              which may interfere with each other; and (7) consider the
              required signal-to-noise ratio for obtaining reliable estimates.
              For each topic, we provide relevant examples, demonstrate
              potential errors of interpretation, and offer suggestions to
              address these issues. We primarily focus on univariate measures,
              such as power and phase estimates, though we discuss how these
              issues can propagate to multivariate measures. These
              considerations and recommendations offer a helpful guide for

                   autoencoders (VAEs), and deep energy-based models are among
                   competing likelihood-based frameworks for deep generative
                   learning. Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and
                   tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks.
                   However, they are currently outperformed by other models
                   such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While
                   the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the
                   statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction
                   of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical
                   VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE
                   built for image generation using depth-wise separable
                   convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with
                   a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its
                   training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show
                   that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among
                   non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST,
                   CIFAR-10, CelebA 64, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides
                   a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE
                   pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per
                   dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ.
                   To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful
                   VAE applied to natural images as large as 256$\times$256

              faithfully replicate the I/O function of various biophysical
              models of cortical neurons at millisecond (spiking) resolution. A
              temporally convolutional DNN with five to eight layers was
              required to capture the I/O mapping of a realistic model of a

              assess the influence of avatar appearance, avatar control and
              user point of view on the Sense of Embodiment (SoE) towards a
              virtual avatar. However, such studies tend to explore each factor
              in isolation. This paper aims to better understand the
              inter-relations among these three factors by conducting a
              subjective matching experiment. In the presented experiment (
              n=40), participants had to match a given ``optimal'' SoE avatar
              configuration (realistic avatar, full-body motion capture,
              first-person point of view), starting by a ``minimal'' SoE
              configuration (minimal avatar, no control, third-person point of
              view), by iteratively increasing the level of each factor. The
              choices of the participants provide insights about their
              preferences and perception over the three factors considered.
              Moreover, the subjective matching procedure was conducted in the
              context of four different interaction tasks with the goal of
              covering a wide range of actions an avatar can do in a VE. The
              paper also describes a baseline experiment ( n=20) which was used
              to define the number and order of the different levels for each
              factor, prior to the subjective matching experiment (e.g.
              different degrees of realism ranging from abstract to
              personalised avatars for the visual appearance). The results of
              the subjective matching experiment show that point of view and
              control levels were consistently increased by users before
              appearance levels when it comes to enhancing the SoE. Second,
              several configurations were identified with equivalent SoE as the
              one felt in the optimal configuration, but vary between the
              tasks. Taken together, our results provide valuable insights
              about which factors to prioritize in order to enhance the SoE
              towards an avatar in different tasks, and about configurations
              which lead to fulfilling SoE in VE.",

              (within the first 4.5 years of treatment) and twenty-four healthy
              controls completed a source memory task. Participants navigated
              through a 3D virtual city, and had 20 encounters of an object
              with a person at a place. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
              was performed during a subsequent forced-choice recognition test.
              Two objects were presented and participants were asked to either
              identify which object was seen (new vs. old object recognition),
              or identify which of the two old objects was associated with
              either the person or the place being presented (source memory
              recognition). Source memory was examined by contrasting person or
              place with object. Both patients and controls demonstrated
              significant neural activity to source memory relative to object
              memory, though activity in controls was much more widespread.

              a virtual environment to characterize episodic memory profiles in
              an ecological fashion, which includes memory for central and
              perceptual details, spatiotemporal contextual elements, and
              binding. This study included subjects from three different
              populations: healthy older adults, patients with amnestic mild
              cognitive impairment (aMCI) and patients with early to moderate
              Alzheimer's disease (AD). Second, we sought to determine whether
              environmental factors that can affect encoding (active vs.
              passive exploration) influence memory performance in pathological
              aging. Third, we benchmarked the results of our virtual reality
              episodic memory test against a classical memory test and a
              subjective daily memory complaint scale. Here, the participants
              were successively immersed in two virtual environments; the
              first, as the driver of a virtual car (active exploration) and
              the second, as the passenger of that car (passive exploration).
              Subjects were instructed to encode all elements of the
              environment as well as the associated spatiotemporal contexts.
              Following each immersion, we assessed the patient's recall and
              recognition of central information (i.e., the elements of the
              environment), contextual information (i.e., temporal, egocentric
              and allocentric spatial information) and lastly, the quality of
              binding. We found that the AD patients' performances were
              inferior to that of the aMCI and even more to that of the healthy
              aged groups, in line with the progression of hippocampal atrophy
              reported in the literature. Spatial allocentric memory
              assessments were found to be particularly useful for
              distinguishing aMCI patients from healthy older adults. Active
              exploration yielded enhanced recall of central and allocentric
              spatial information, as well as binding in all groups. This led
              aMCI patients to achieve better performance scores on immediate
              temporal memory tasks. Finally, the patients' daily memory
              complaints were more highly correlated with the performances on
              the virtual test than with their performances on the classical
              memory test. Taken together, these results highlight specific
              cognitive differences found between these three populations that
              may provide additional insight into the early diagnosis and
              rehabilitation of pathological aging. In particular,
              neuropsychological studies would benefit to use virtual tests and
              a multi-component approach to assess episodic memory, and
              encourage active encoding of information in patients suffering
              from mild or severe age-related memory impairment. The beneficial
              effect of active encoding on episodic memory in aMCI and early to
              moderate AD is discussed in the context of relatively preserved

              has been shown to acutely improve performance in sensory
              detection tasks. One explanation for this behavioral effect is
              stochastic resonance (SR), a mechanism that explains how signal
              processing in nonlinear systems can benefit from added noise.
              While acute noise benefits of electrical RNS have been
              demonstrated at the behavioral level as well as in in vitro
              preparations of neural tissue, it is currently largely unknown
              whether similar effects can be shown at the neural population
              level using neurophysiological readouts of human cortex. Here, we
              hypothesized that acute tRNS will increase the responsiveness of
              primary motor cortex (M1) when probed with transcranial magnetic
              stimulation (TMS). Neural responsiveness was operationalized via
              the well-known concept of the resting motor threshold (RMT). We
              showed that tRNS acutely decreases RMT. This effect was small,
              but it was consistently replicated across four experiments
              including different cohorts (total N = 81, 46 females, 35 males),
              two tRNS electrode montages, and different control conditions.
              Our experiments provide critical neurophysiological evidence that
              tRNS can acutely generate noise benefits by enhancing the neural
              population response of human M1.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A hallmark
              feature of stochastic resonance (SR) is that signal processing
              can benefit from added noise. This has mainly been demonstrated
              at the single-cell level in vitro where the neural response to
              weak input signals can be enhanced by simultaneously applying
              random noise. Our finding that transcranial random noise
              stimulation (tRNS) acutely increases the excitability of
              corticomotor circuits extends the principle of noise benefits to
              the neural population level in human cortex. Our finding is in
              line with the notion that tRNS might affect cortical processing
              via the SR phenomenon. It suggests that enhancing the response of
              cortical populations to an external stimulus might be one
              neurophysiological mechanism mediating performance improvements
              when tRNS is applied to sensory cortex during perception tasks.",

              mapping to identify design elements of existing research

              reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information
              from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries,
              which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion,
              semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three
              key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning
              contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a
              foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was
              conducted between application domains and learning contents and
              between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has
              uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher
              education sphere---for instance, learning theories were not often
              considered in VR application development to assist and guide
              toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of
              educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of
              the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has
              mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather
              than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR
              seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18
              application domains, indicating a better reception of this
              technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward

              1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of
              researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of
              this technology producing 1000s of scientific papers. What is the
              outcome of this significant research work? This paper wants to
              provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced
              scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the
              field. We collected all the existent articles about VR in the Web
              of Science Core Collection scientific database, and the resultant
              dataset contained 21,667 records for VR and 9,944 for augmented
              reality (AR). The bibliographic record contained various fields,
              such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references
              (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster
              analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama
              characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed,
              whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on VR
              concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently
              journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly,
              if at first computer science was the leading research field,
              nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of
              countries involved in VR research. The present work discusses the
              evolution and changes over the time of the use of VR in the main
              areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected VR's
              capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the
              disruptive contribution that VR/AR/MRITF will be able to get in
              scientific fields, as well in human communication and
              interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones
              by increasing the use and the development of scientific
              applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the
              social communication and interaction among people.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior
              cingulate cortex (ACC) are two of the most important cortical
              brain regions encoding the sensory-discriminative and
              affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. However, the
              functional connectivity of these two areas during pain processing
              remains unclear. Developing methods to dissect the functional
              connectivity and directed information flow between cortical pain
              circuits can reveal insight into neural mechanisms of pain
              perception. APPROACH: We recorded multichannel local field
              potentials (LFPs) from the S1 and ACC in freely behaving rats
              under various conditions of pain stimulus (thermal versus
              mechanical) and pain state (naive versus chronic pain). We
              applied Granger causality (GC) analysis to the LFP recordings and
              inferred frequency-dependent GC statistics between the S1 and
              ACC. MAIN RESULTS: We found an increased information flow during
              noxious pain stimulus presentation in both S1[Formula: see
              text]ACC and ACC[Formula: see text]S1 directions, especially at
              theta and gamma frequency bands. Similar results were found for
              thermal and mechanical pain stimuli. The chronic pain state
              shares common observations, except for further elevated GC
              measures especially in the gamma band. Furthermore, time-varying
              GC analysis revealed a negative correlation between the
              direction-specific and frequency-dependent GC and animal's paw
              withdrawal latency. In addition, we used computer simulations to
              investigate the impact of model mismatch, noise, missing
              variables, and common input on the conditional GC estimate. We
              also compared the GC results with the transfer entropy (TE)
              estimates. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results reveal functional
              connectivity and directed information flow between the S1 and ACC
              during various pain conditions. The dynamic GC analysis support
              the hypothesis of cortico-cortical information loop in pain

  abstract = "In recent years, several hierarchical extensions of well-known
              learning algorithms have been proposed. For example, when
              stimulus-action mappings vary across time or context, the brain
              may learn two or more stimulus-action mappings in separate
              modules, and additionally (at a hierarchically higher level)
              learn to appropriately switch between those modules. However, how
              the brain mechanistically coordinates neural communication to
              implement such hierarchical learning remains unknown. Therefore,
              the current study tests a recent computational model that
              proposed how midfrontal theta oscillations implement such
              hierarchical learning via the principle of binding by synchrony
              (Sync model). More specifically, the Sync model uses bursts at
              theta frequency to flexibly bind appropriate task modules by
              synchrony. The 64-channel EEG signal was recorded while 27 human
              subjects (female: 21, male: 6) performed a probabilistic reversal
              learning task. In line with the Sync model, postfeedback theta
              power showed a linear relationship with negative prediction
              errors, but not with positive prediction errors. This
              relationship was especially pronounced for subjects with better
              behavioral fit (measured via Akaike information criterion) of the
              Sync model. Also consistent with Sync model simulations, theta
              phase-coupling between midfrontal electrodes and temporoparietal
              electrodes was stronger after negative feedback. Our data suggest
              that the brain uses theta power and synchronization for flexibly
              switching between task rule modules, as is useful, for example,
              when multiple stimulus-action mappings must be retained and
              used.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Everyday life requires flexibility in
              switching between several rules. A key question in understanding
              this ability is how the brain mechanistically coordinates such
              switches. The current study tests a recent computational
              framework (Sync model) that proposed how midfrontal theta
              oscillations coordinate activity in hierarchically lower
              task-related areas. In line with predictions of this Sync model,
              midfrontal theta power was stronger when rule switches were most
              likely (strong negative prediction error), especially in subjects
              who obtained a better model fit. Additionally, also theta phase
              connectivity between midfrontal and task-related areas was
              increased after negative feedback. Thus, the data provided
              support for the hypothesis that the brain uses theta power and

  author   = "Hoel, Erik",
  abstract = "Understanding of the evolved biological function of sleep has
              advanced considerably in the past decade. However, no equivalent
              understanding of dreams has emerged. Contemporary neuroscientific
              theories often view dreams as epiphenomena, and many of the
              proposals for their biological function are contradicted by the
              phenomenology of dreams themselves. Now, the recent advent of
              deep neural networks (DNNs) has finally provided the novel
              conceptual framework within which to understand the evolved
              function of dreams. Notably, all DNNs face the issue of
              overfitting as they learn, which is when performance on one
              dataset increases but the network's performance fails to
              generalize (often measured by the divergence of performance on
              training versus testing datasets). This ubiquitous problem in
              DNNs is often solved by modelers via ``noise injections'' in the
              form of noisy or corrupted inputs. The goal of this paper is to
              argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overfitting and
              that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain's overfitting
              during its daily learning. That is, dreams are a biological
              mechanism for increasing generalizability via the creation of
              corrupted sensory inputs from stochastic activity across the
              hierarchy of neural structures. Sleep loss, specifically dream
              loss, leads to an overfitted brain that can still memorize and
              learn but fails to generalize appropriately. Herein this
              ``overfitted brain hypothesis'' is explicitly developed and then
              compared and contrasted with existing contemporary
              neuroscientific theories of dreams. Existing evidence for the
              hypothesis is surveyed within both neuroscience and deep
              learning, and a set of testable predictions is put forward that
              can be pursued both in vivo and in silico.",

              Increasing the amplitude and train duration increased the

              found that increasing the frequency evoked more intense percepts

              percept qualities at different stimulus frequencies. Neighboring

              mechanisms underlying the evoked sensations remain unknown. To
              understand how specific stimulation parameters elicit certain

              sensations in the brain. In this study we record from

              cortex, and posterior parietal cortex of a male human participant
              performing a somatosensory imagery task. The sensations imagined

              sensations will be important in advancing such devices. Here, we
              investigate the neural activity in human primary somatosensory,
              premotor, and parietal cortices during somatosensory imagery. The
              sensations imagined were those previously elicited during

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Microstimulation in human sensory thalamus
              (ventrocaudal, VC) results in focal sensory percepts in the hand
              and arm which may provide an alternative target site (to
              somatosensory cortex) for the input of prosthetic sensory
              information. Sensory feedback to facilitate motor function may
              require simultaneous or timed responses across separate digits to
              recreate perceptions of slip as well as encoding of intensity
              variations in pressure or touch. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
              feasibility of evoking sensory percepts on separate digits with
              variable intensity through either a microwire array or deep brain
              stimulation (DBS) electrode, recreating ``natural'' and scalable
              percepts relating to the arm and hand. METHODS: We compared
              microstimulation within ventrocaudal sensory thalamus through
              either a 16-channel microwire array (∼400 k$\Omega$ per channel)
              or a 4-channel DBS electrode (∼1.2 k$\Omega$ per contact) for
              percept location, size, intensity, and quality sensation, during
              thalamic DBS electrode placement in patients with essential
              tremor. RESULTS: Percepts in small hand or finger regions were
              evoked by microstimulation through individual microwires and in
              5/6 patients sensation on different digits could be perceived
              from stimulation through separate microwires. Microstimulation
              through DBS electrode contacts evoked sensations over larger
              areas in 5/5 patients, and the apparent intensity of the
              perceived response could be modulated with stimulation amplitude.
              The perceived naturalness of the sensation depended both on the
              pattern of stimulation as well as intensity of the stimulation.
              CONCLUSIONS: Producing consistent evoked perceptions across
              separate digits within sensory thalamus is a feasible concept and
              a compact alternative to somatosensory cortex microstimulation
              for prosthetic sensory feedback. This approach will require a
              multi-element low impedance electrode with a sufficient
              stimulation range to evoke variable intensities of perception and
              a predictable spread of contacts to engage separate digits.",

              has been successful in evoking artificial somatosensation in both
              humans and animals, but much is unknown about the optimal
              stimulation parameters needed to generate robust percepts of

              frequency as an adjustable stimulation parameter for artificial
              somatosensation in a closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI)
              system. METHODS: Three epilepsy patients with subdural
              mini-electrocorticography grids over the hand area of S1 were
              asked to compare the percepts elicited with different stimulation
              frequencies. Amplitude, pulse width, and duration were held
              constant across all trials. In each trial, subjects experienced 2
              stimuli and reported which they thought was given at a higher
              stimulation frequency. Two paradigms were used: first, 50 versus
              100 Hz to establish the utility of comparing frequencies, and
              then 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 Hz were pseudorandomly compared.
              RESULTS: As the magnitude of the stimulation frequency was
              increased, subjects described percepts that were ``more intense''
              or ``faster.'' Cumulatively, the participants achieved 98.0\%
              accuracy when comparing stimulation at 50 and 100 Hz. In the
              second paradigm, the corresponding overall accuracy was 73.3\%.
              If both tested frequencies were less than or equal to 10 Hz,
              accuracy was 41.7\% and increased to 79.4\% when one frequency
              was greater than 10 Hz (p = 0.01). When both stimulation
              frequencies were 20 Hz or less, accuracy was 40.7\% compared with
              91.7\% when one frequency was greater than 20 Hz (p < 0.001).
              Accuracy was 85\% in trials in which 50 Hz was the higher
              stimulation frequency. Therefore, the lower limit of detection
              occurred at 20 Hz, and accuracy decreased significantly when
              lower frequencies were tested. In trials testing 10 Hz versus 20
              Hz, accuracy was 16.7\% compared with 85.7\% in trials testing 20
              Hz versus 50 Hz (p < 0.05). Accuracy was greater than chance at
              frequency differences greater than or equal to 30 Hz.
              CONCLUSIONS: Frequencies greater than 20 Hz may be used as an
              adjustable parameter to elicit distinguishable percepts. These
              findings may be useful in informing the settings and the degrees

              feedback from brain-controlled bionic hands. Changes in ICMS
              frequency lead to changes in the resulting sensation, but the
              discriminability of frequency has only been investigated over a
              narrow range of low frequencies. Furthermore, the sensory
              correlates of changes in ICMS frequency remain poorly understood.
              Specifically, it remains to be elucidated whether changes in
              frequency only modulate sensation magnitude-as do changes in
              amplitude-or whether they also modulate the quality of the
              sensation. To fill these gaps, we trained monkeys to discriminate
              the frequency of ICMS pulse trains over a wide range of
              frequencies (from 10 to 400 Hz). ICMS amplitude also varied
              across stimuli to dissociate sensation magnitude from ICMS
              frequency and ensure that animals could not make frequency
              judgments based on magnitude. We found that animals could

              diseases lacks the active participation of patients, its process
              is monotonous and tedious, and the effects need to be improved.
              Therefore, a new type of rehabilitation technology with more
              active participation combining brain-computer interface (BCI)
              with virtual reality (VR) has developed rapidly in recent years
              and has been used in rehabilitation in neurological diseases.
              OBJECTIVES: This narrative review analyzed and characterized the
              development and application of the new training system (BCI-VR)
              in rehabilitation of neurological diseases from the perspective
              of the BCI paradigm, to provide a pathway for future research in
              this field. METHODS: The review involved a search of the Web of
              Science-Science Citation Index/Social Sciences Citation Index and
              the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases; 39 papers
              were selected. Advantages and challenges of BCI-VR - based
              neurological rehabilitation were analyzed in detail. RESULTS:
              Most BCI-VR studies included could be classified by 3 major BCI
              paradigms: motor imagery, P300, and steady-state visual-evoked
              potential. Integrating VR scenes into BCI systems could
              effectively promote the recovery process from nervous system
              injuries as compared with traditional methods. CONCLUSION: As
              compared with rehabilitation based on traditional BCI,
              rehabilitation based on BCI-VR can provide better feedback
              information for patients and promote the recovery of brain
              function. By solving the challenges and continual development,
              the BCI-VR system can be broadly applied to the clinical
              treatment of various neurological diseases.",

              evolution. However, it has been difficult to study whether active

  abstract = "KEY POINTS: Several behavioural studies have shown the sensory
              perceptions are reduced during movement; yet the
              neurophysiological reason for this is not clear. Participants
              underwent stimulation of the median nerve when either sitting
              quietly (i.e. passive stimulation condition) or performing haptic
              exploration of a ball with the left hand. Magnetoencephalographic
              brain imaging and advanced beamforming methods were used to
              identify the differences in somatosensory cortical responses. We
              show that the neural populations active during the passive
              stimulation condition were strongly gated during the haptic
              exploration task. These results imply that the reduced haptic
              perceptions might be governed by gating of certain somatosensory
              neural populations. ABSTRACT: Several behavioural studies have
              shown that children have reduced sensory perceptions during
              movement; however, the neurophysiological nexus for these altered
              perceptions remains unknown. We used magnetoencephalographic
              brain imaging and advanced beamforming methods to address this
              knowledge gap. In our experiment, a cohort of children (aged
              10-18 years) underwent stimulation of the median nerve when
              either sitting quietly (i.e. passive stimulation condition) or
              performing haptic exploration of a ball with the left hand. Our
              results revealed two novel observations. First, there was a
              relationship between the child's age and the strength of the beta
              (18-26 Hz) response seen within the somatosensory cortices during
              the passive stimulation condition. This suggests that there may
              be an age-dependent change in the processing of peripheral
              feedback by the somatosensory cortices. Second, all of the
              cortical regions that were active during the passive stimulation
              condition were almost completely gated during the haptic task.
              Instead, the haptic task involved neural oscillations within
              Brodmann area 2, which is known to convey less spatially precise
              tactile information but is involved in the processing of more
              complex somatosensations across the respective digits. These
              results imply that the reduced somatosensory perceptions seen
              during movements in healthy children may be related to the gating
              of certain neural generators, as well as activation of
              haptic-specific neural generators within the somatosensory
              cortices. The utilization of such haptic-specific circuits during
              development may lead to the enhanced somatosensory processing
              during haptic exploration seen in healthy adults.",

              (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). A brain-computer interface
              (BCI), which links the brain directly to a computer, offers a new
              way to study the brain and potentially restore impairments in
              patients living with these debilitating conditions. One of the
              challenges currently facing BCI technology, however, is to
              minimize surgical risk while maintaining efficacy. Minimally
              invasive techniques, such as stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG)
              have become more widely used in clinical applications in epilepsy
              patients since they can lead to fewer complications. SEEG depth
              electrodes also give access to sulcal and white matter areas of
              the brain but have not been widely studied in brain-computer
              interfaces. Here we show the first demonstration of decoding
              sulcal and subcortical activity related to both movement and
              tactile sensation in the human hand. Furthermore, we have
              compared decoding performance in SEEG-based depth recordings
              versus those obtained with electrocorticography electrodes (ECoG)
              placed on gyri. Initial poor decoding performance and the
              observation that most neural modulation patterns varied in
              amplitude trial-to-trial and were transient (significantly
              shorter than the sustained finger movements studied), led to the
              development of a feature selection method based on a
              repeatability metric using temporal correlation. An algorithm
              based on temporal correlation was developed to isolate features
              that consistently repeated (required for accurate decoding) and
              possessed information content related to movement or
              touch-related stimuli. We subsequently used these features, along
              with deep learning methods, to automatically classify various
              motor and sensory events for individual fingers with high
              accuracy. Repeating features were found in sulcal, gyral, and
              white matter areas and were predominantly phasic or phasic-tonic
              across a wide frequency range for both HD (high density) ECoG and
              SEEG recordings. These findings motivated the use of long
              short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which
              are well-suited to handling transient input features. Combining
              temporal correlation-based feature selection with LSTM yielded
              decoding accuracies of up to 92.04 $\pm$ 1.51\% for hand
              movements, up to 91.69 $\pm$ 0.49\% for individual finger
              movements, and up to 83.49 $\pm$ 0.72\% for focal tactile stimuli
              to individual finger pads while using a relatively small number
              of SEEG electrodes. These findings may lead to a new class of

               the interface task by task. In the implementation of BCI, the
               OPENBCI hardware was used for signal acquisition and the MATLAB
               software for processing. Five mental tasks were defined that
               activated different regions of the cerebral cortex. The

              neural correlates associated with delayed haptic feedback. In

              passive and active tasks performed using a haptic device and a

  abstract = "When learning a new skill through unknown environment, should we
              practice alone, or together with another beginner, or learn from
              the expert? It is normally helpful to have an expert guiding
              through unknown environmental dynamics. The guidance from the
              expert is fundamentally based on the mutual interactions. From
              the perspective of the beginner, one needs to face dual unknown
              dynamics of environment and motor coordination of the expert. In
              a cooperative visuo-haptic motor task, we asked novice
              participants to bring a virtual mass onto the specified target
              location under an unknown external force field. The task was
              completed by an individual or with an expert or another novice.
              In addition to evaluation of the motor performance, we evaluated
              the adaptability of the novice participants to a new partner
              while attempting to achieve a common goal together. The
              experiment was set in 5 phases; baseline, learning and evaluation
              phase for skill learning and adaptability. The performance of the
              participants was characterized by using time to target, effort
              index and length of trajectory. Experimental results suggested;
              (1) Peer-to-peer interactions among paired beginners enhanced the
              motor learning most, (2) Individuals practicing on their own
              (learning as a single) showed the better motor learning than
              practicing under the expert's guidance, and (3) Regarding the
              adaptability, peer-to-peer interactions induced higher
              adaptability to a new partner than the novice-to-expert
              interactions while attempting to achieve a common goal together.
              Thus, we conclude that the peer-to-peer interactions under a
              collaborative task can realise the best motor learning of the
              motor skills through the new environmental dynamics, and
              adaptability to others in order to achieve a goal together. We
              suggest that the peer-to-peer learning can induce both
              adaptability to others and learning of motor skills through the
              unknown environmental dynamics under mutual interactions. On the
              other words, during the peer-to-peer interactions, the novice can
              learn how to coordinate motion with his/her partner (even though
              one is a new partner), and thus, is able to learn the motor
              skills through new environmental dynamics.",

              identified as groups of interactions with co-varying strengths.
              In this study, five subjects implanted with ECoG grids over
              language areas performed word repetition and picture naming. We
              estimated the interaction strength between each pair of
              electrodes during each task using a time-varying dynamic Bayesian
              network (tvDBN) model constructed from the power of high gamma
              (70-110Hz) activity, a surrogate for population firing rates. We

              each interaction's contribution to a particular subnetwork, and
              the temporal profile of each subnetwork's activation during the
              task. We found FNCs with temporal and anatomical features

              auditory and visual processing in the word repetition and picture
              naming tasks, respectively. These FNCs were highly consistent
              between subjects with similar electrode placement, and were
              robust enough to be characterized in single trials. Furthermore,
              the interaction patterns uncovered by FNC analysis correlated

              hypothesized that the patterns by which high frequency activity
              is propagated would help elucidate epileptogenic networks and
              thereby identify network nodes relevant for surgical planning.
              Intracranial EEG recordings were analyzed with a multivariate
              autoregressive modeling technique (short-time direct directed
              transfer function--SdDTF), based on the concept of Granger
              causality, to estimate the directionality and intensity of
              propagation of high frequency activity (70-175 Hz) during ictal
              and interictal recordings. These analyses revealed prominent
              divergence and convergence of high frequency activity propagation
              at sites identified by epileptologists as part of the ictal onset
              zone. In contrast, relatively little propagation of this activity
              was observed among the other analyzed sites. This pattern was
              observed in both subdural and depth electrode recordings of
              patients with focal ictal onset, but not in patients with a
              widely distributed ictal onset. In patients with focal ictal
              onsets, the patterns of propagation recorded during pre-ictal (up
              to 5 min immediately preceding ictal onset) and interictal (more
              than 24h before and after seizures) intervals were very similar
              to those recorded during seizures. The ability to characterize
              epileptogenic networks from interictal recordings could have
              important clinical implications for epilepsy surgery planning by
              reducing the need for prolonged invasive monitoring to record
              spontaneous seizures.",

              provide a fast and natural way of communication to people with
              neurological diseases. Invasively-measured brain activity
              (electrocorticography; ECoG) supplies the necessary temporal and
              spatial resolution to decode fast and complex processes such as
              speech production. A number of impressive advances in speech
              decoding using neural signals have been achieved in recent years,
              but the complex dynamics are still not fully understood. However,
              it is unlikely that simple linear models can capture the relation
              between neural activity and continuous spoken speech. APPROACH:
              Here we show that deep neural networks can be used to map ECoG
              from speech production areas onto an intermediate representation
              of speech (logMel spectrogram). The proposed method uses a
              densely connected convolutional neural network topology which is
              well-suited to work with the small amount of data available from
              each participant. MAIN RESULTS: In a study with six participants,
              we achieved correlations up to r = 0.69 between the reconstructed
              and original logMel spectrograms. We transfered our prediction
              back into an audible waveform by applying a Wavenet vocoder. The
              vocoder was conditioned on logMel features that harnessed a much
              larger, pre-existing data corpus to provide the most natural
              acoustic output. SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge, this
              is the first time that high-quality speech has been reconstructed

              cortex evokes sensory perceptions, and is thus a promising option
              for closing the loop. Before this can be implemented in humans it
              is necessary to evaluate how changes in stimulus parameters are
              perceived and the extent to which they can be discriminated.
              APPROACH: Electrical stimulation was delivered to the

              conductivity on the activation of cortical neurons was
              investigated in a realistic head model. In this paper, we
              constructed pyramidal neuronal models (layers 3 and 5) that
              showed primary excitation of the corticospinal tract, and an
              anatomically realistic head model reflecting complex brain
              geometry. The anisotropic information was acquired from diffusion
              tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) and then applied to
              the white matter at various ratios of anisotropic conductivity.
              First, we compared the isotropic and anisotropic models; compared
              to the isotropic model, the anisotropic model showed that neurons

              significant clinical risks and has limited stability. We

              with different types of motor and speech imagery. Over brief

              performance due to changes in inhibitory neurotransmission.
              Double-blind tDCS (Anodal/Sham) of 1 mA was delivered for 600 s

              often ineffective. Brain-computer interfaces are being developed
              to enhance independence and restore communication in the absence
              of physical movement. Over the past decade, individuals with
              tetraplegia have achieved rapid on-screen typing and
              point-and-click control of tablet apps using intracortical
              brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) that decode intended arm and
              hand movements from neural signals recorded by implanted
              microelectrode arrays. However, cables used to convey neural
              signals from the brain tether participants to amplifiers and
              decoding computers and require expert oversight, severely
              limiting when and where iBCIs could be available for use. Here,
              we demonstrate the first human use of a wireless broadband iBCI.
              METHODS: Based on a prototype system previously used in
              pre-clinical research, we replaced the external cables of a
              192-electrode iBCI with wireless transmitters and achieved
              high-resolution recording and decoding of broadband field
              potentials and spiking activity from people with paralysis. Two
              participants in an ongoing pilot clinical trial completed
              on-screen item selection tasks to assess iBCI-enabled cursor
              control. RESULTS: Communication bitrates were equivalent between
              cabled and wireless configurations. Participants also used the
              wireless iBCI to control a standard commercial tablet computer to
              browse the web and use several mobile applications. Within-day
              comparison of cabled and wireless interfaces evaluated bit error
              rate, packet loss, and the recovery of spike rates and spike
              waveforms from the recorded neural signals. In a representative
              use case, the wireless system recorded intracortical signals from
              two arrays in one participant continuously through a 24-hour
              period at home. SIGNIFICANCE: Wireless multi-electrode recording
              of broadband neural signals over extended periods introduces a

              Here we show that a significant number of neurons in these areas
              also represent body position and orientation in space. Two rhesus
              monkeys (K and M) used a wheelchair controlled by a brain-machine
              interface (BMI) to navigate in a room. During this whole-body
              navigation, the discharge rates of M1, S1, and PMd neurons
              correlated with the two-dimensional (2D) room position and the

              distortion and forgetting, presenting a fundamental challenge for
              neuroscientific studies of dreaming. Here we show that
              individuals who are asleep and in the midst of a lucid dream
              (aware of the fact that they are currently dreaming) can perceive
              questions from an experimenter and provide answers using

              two-way communication during polysomnographically verified
              rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in 36 individuals. Some had
              minimal prior experience with lucid dreaming, others were
              frequent lucid dreamers, and one was a patient with narcolepsy

  author   = "Yazdan-Shahmorad, Azadeh and Kipke, Daryl R and Lehmkuhle, Mark J",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Cortical electrical stimulation (CES) has been used
              extensively in experimental neuroscience to modulate neuronal or
              behavioral activity, which has led this technique to be
              considered in neurorehabilitation. Because the cortex and the
              surrounding anatomy have irregular geometries as well as
              inhomogeneous and anisotropic electrical properties, the
              mechanism by which CES has therapeutic effects is poorly
              understood. Therapeutic effects of CES can be improved by
              optimizing the stimulation parameters based on the effects of
              various stimulation parameters on target brain regions. APPROACH:
              In this study we have compared the effects of CES pulse polarity,
              frequency, and amplitude on unit activity recorded from rat
              primary motor cortex with the effects on the corresponding local
              field potentials (LFP), and electrocorticograms (ECoG). CES was
              applied at the surface of the cortex and the unit activity and
              LFPs were recorded using a penetrating electrode array, which was
              implanted below the stimulation site. ECoGs were recorded from
              the vicinity of the stimulation site. MAIN RESULTS:
              Time-frequency analysis of LFPs following CES showed correlation
              of gamma frequencies with unit activity response in all layers.
              More importantly, high gamma power of ECoG signals only
              correlated with the unit activity in lower layers (V-VI)
              following CES. Time-frequency correlations, which were found
              between LFPs, ECoGs and unit activity, were frequency- and
              amplitude-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE: The signature of the neural
              activity observed in LFP and ECoG signals provides a better
              understanding of the effects of stimulation on network activity,
              representative of large numbers of neurons responding to
              stimulation. These results demonstrate that the
              neurorehabilitation and neuroprosthetic applications of CES
              targeting layered cortex can be further improved by using field
              potential recordings as surrogates to unit activity aimed at
              optimizing stimulation efficacy. Likewise, the signatures of unit
              activity observed as changes in high gamma power in ECoGs suggest
              that future cortical stimulation studies could rely on less
              invasive feedback schemes that incorporate surface stimulation
              with ECoG reporting of stimulation efficacy.",

              speed, that is, the magnitude of the (directional) velocity
              vector. Recently, there is also increasing interest in the
              representation of movement parameters in neuronal population
              activity, such as reflected in the intracranial EEG (iEEG). We
              show that in iEEG, contrasting to what has been previously found
              on the single neuron level, speed predominates over velocity. The
              predominant speed representation was present in nearly all iEEG
              signal features, up to the 600-1000 Hz range. Using a model of

               stratified into two groups: the experimental (n = 11) and the
               control group (n = 11). Parameters associated with balance and
               gait were measured using the 6-minute walk test, the 10-meter
               walk test, the timed ``up and go'' test, the functional gait
               assessment, and the four square step test. Gait analysis using
               the zebris Rehawalk\textregistered{} treadmill system was also
               performed. Patients in the experimental group received virtual
               reality-based treadmill training five times a week for a period
               of four weeks, while those in the control group received
               treadmill training at the same frequency, duration, intensity,
               and structure, along with a progressively more difficult task
               demands. Significant improvements were observed in selected
               outcome measures in both groups after training. Patients in the
               experimental group experienced improvements in all of the
               spatiotemporal gait parameters, but there was a significant
               difference before and after training in duration of double
               support and lateral asymmetry. The findings of this pilot

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Reorienting is central to how humans direct attention
              to diﬀerent stimuli in their environment. Previous studies
              typically employ well-controlled paradigms with limited eye and
              head movements to study the neural and physiological processes
              underlying attention reorienting. Here, we aim to better
              understand the relationship between gaze and attention
              reorienting using a naturalistic virtual reality (VR)-based
              target detection paradigm. APPROACH: Subjects were navigated
              through a city and instructed to count the number of targets that
              appeared on the street. Subjects performed the task in a ﬁxed
              condition with no head movement and in a free condition where
              head movements were allowed. Electroencephalography (EEG), gaze
              and pupil data were collected. To investigate how neural and
              physiological reorienting signals are distributed across diﬀerent
              gaze events, we used hierarchical discriminant component analysis
              (HDCA) to identify EEG and pupil-based discriminating components.
              Mixedeﬀects general linear models (GLM) were used to determine
              the correlation between these discriminating components and the
              diﬀerent gaze events time. HDCA was also used to combine EEG,
              pupil and dwell time signals to classify reorienting events. MAIN
              RESULTS: In both EEG and pupil, dwell time contributes most
              signiﬁcantly to the reorienting signals. However, when dwell
              times were orthogonalized against other gaze events, the
              distributions of the reorienting signals were diﬀerent across the
              two modalities, with EEG reorienting signals leading that of the
              pupil reorienting signals. We also found that the hybrid
              classiﬁer that integrates EEG, pupil and dwell time features
              detects the reorienting signals in both the ﬁxed (AUC = 0.79) and
              the free (AUC = 0.77) condition. Signiﬁcance. We show that the
              neural and ocular reorienting signals are distributed diﬀerently
              across gaze events when a subject is immersed in VR, but
              nevertheless can be captured and integrated to classify target
              vs. distractor objects to which the human subject orients.",

              study's goal is to compare the effectiveness of immersive virtual
              reality (VR) training in balance among individuals with
              incomplete paraplegia to that of functional electrical
              stimulation (FES). DESIGN: Two groups, randomized clinical trial.
              SETTING: Neurological Physiotherapy Out Patient Department,
              Tertiary Care Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen people aged 18-60
              years with incomplete SCI. INTERVENTIONS: VR training along with
              conventional physical therapy (CPT) and FES for Rectus Abdominis
              and Erector Spinae with CPT five times a week for 4 weeks.
              OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were Modified Functional
              Reach Test (mFRT) and Function in Sitting Test (FIST) to assess
              sitting balance and Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM
              III) for the level of independence. Assessments were taken before
              initiating treatment and at the end of the 2 and 4 weeks after
              treatment. Within-group analyses for the mFRT values were
              performed using Repeated Measures ANOVA test, and between-group
              analyses were performed using the independent t-test test.
              Friedman and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for analyzing FIST
              and SCIM III. RESULTS: All variables (mFRT and FIST) improved
              significantly in both groups (P < 0.05), with the VR + CPT group
              showing a more significant result than the FES + CPT group (P

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Learning and learning-related neuroplasticity in
              motor cortex are potential mechanisms mediating recovery of
              movement abilities after stroke. These mechanisms depend on
              dopaminergic projections from midbrain that may encode reward
              information. Likewise, therapist experience confirms the role of
              feedback/reward for training efficacy after stroke. OBJECTIVE: To
              test the hypothesis that rehabilitative training can be enhanced
              by adding performance feedback and monetary rewards. METHODS:
              This multicentric, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial
              used the ArmeoSenso virtual reality rehabilitation system to
              train 37 first-ever subacute stroke patients in arm-reaching to
              moving targets. The rewarded group (n = 19) trained with
              performance feedback (gameplay) and contingent monetary reward.
              The control group (n = 18) used the same system without monetary
              reward and with graphically minimized performance feedback.
              Primary outcome was the change in the two-dimensional reaching
              space until the end of the intervention period. Secondary
              clinical assessments were performed at baseline, after 3 weeks of
              training (15 1-hour sessions), and at 3 month follow-up. Duration
              and intensity of the interventions as well as concomitant therapy
              were comparable between groups. RESULTS: The two-dimensional
              reaching space showed an overall improvement but no difference
              between groups. The rewarded group, however, showed significantly
              greater improvements from baseline in secondary outcomes
              assessing arm activity (Box and Block Test at post-training:
              6.03$\pm$2.95, P = .046 and 3 months: 9.66$\pm$3.11, P = .003;
              Wolf Motor Function Test [Score] at 3 months: .63$\pm$.22, P =
              .007) and arm impairment (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity at 3 months:
              8.22$\pm$3.11, P = .011). CONCLUSIONS: Although neutral in its
              primary outcome, the trial signals a potential facilitating
              effect of reward on training-mediated improvement of arm paresis.

                   modalities in virtual reality (VR) due to its merits in
                   naturalness and intuitiveness, but the interaction suffers
                   from the lack of haptic feedback as no force or vibrotactile
                   feedback can be provided in mid-air. As a breakthrough to
                   compensate for this insufficiency, the application of
                   pseudo-haptic features which create the visuo-haptic
                   illusion without actual physical haptic stimulus can be
                   explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the
                   effect of four pseudo-haptic features: proximity feedback,
                   protrusion, hit effect, and penetration blocking on user
                   experience for free-hand mid-air button interaction in VR.
                   We conducted a user study on 21 young subjects to collect
                   user ratings on various aspects of user experience while
                   users were freely interacting with 16 buttons with different
                   combinations of four features. Results indicated that all
                   investigated features significantly improved user experience

                   spatiotemporal perception, satisfaction, and hedonic
                   quality. In addition, protrusion and hit effect were more
                   beneficial in comparison with the other two features. It is
                   recommended to utilize the four proposed pseudo-haptic
                   features in 3D user interfaces (UIs) to make users feel more
                   pleased and amused, but caution is needed when using
                   proximity feedback together with other features. The
                   findings of this study could be helpful for VR developers
                   and UI designers in providing better interactive buttons in

              from walking, virtual reality can provide an opportunity for
              virtual walking or travel. In this study, a virtual walking
              system was developed in which users view omnidirectional movies
              while receiving scene-congruent vibrations to their left and
              right forefeet and heels. The timings of foot vibrations were
              generated by estimating the camera motion trajectory with visual
              simultaneous localization and mapping (visual SLAM) applied to
              four omnidirectional movies. Congruent vibration patterns were
              prepared for four ground scenes. Modulation of walking-related
              sensations and ground material perceptions by congruent and
              incongruent vibrations was verified using psychological
              measurements. The results showed that rhythmic foot vibration
              improved the sensations of self-motion, walking, leg action, and
              telepresence irrespective of scene--vibration congruency.
              Moreover, congruent vibrations were better than incongruent
              vibrations for walking-related sensations and telepresence in
              indoor corridors and snowy ground scenes. The perception of
              ground materials was enhanced by scene-congruent vibrations,
              whereas it was confused by scene-incongruent vibrations. These
              findings suggest that vibration patterns do not necessarily need
              to match the ground exactly to induce virtual walking sensations;
              however, scene-congruent or similar vibrations improve virtual
              walking sensations and ground material perception. By applying

              paradigm to examine how visual perspective during encoding
              influences memories. Across two studies, participants explored
              immersive virtual environments from first-person and third-person
              avatar perspectives while wearing an Oculus Rift headset. Memory
              was tested immediately (Study One and Study Two) and following a
              one-week delay (Study Two). We assessed the accuracy of visual
              memory using cued recall questions and spatial memory by asking
              participants to draw maps of the layout of each environment

              information across the two studies, but 3PP experiences were
              found to increase spatial memory accuracy due to their wider
              camera field of view when compared to 1PP experiences. Our
              results also demonstrate that 3PP experiences create 3PP
              memories, as reflected by an increase in subjective ratings of
              observer-like perspectives during remembering. In sum, visual

              however outcome parameters of previous studies have primarily
              been of a subjective nature and susceptible to bias. This study
              investigated the effect of VR on cortical processing of evoked
              potentials (EPs) and subjectively reported pain. Additionally, we
              explored whether subjects' demographic and personal
              characteristics modulated the effect of VR analgesia. METHODS:
              Three VR conditions were compared in a randomized cross-over
              study of 30 healthy volunteers: Passive VR (i.e. no interaction
              possible with the virtual world), active VR (interactive virtual
              environment) and no VR (black screen). Subjects received noxious
              electrical stimuli at random intervals during all conditions.
              EPs, recorded at Cz, were extracted time locked to stimuli. Pain
              scores were reported after each condition. RESULTS: Active VR
              significantly decreased pain scores and amplitudes of N1 and P3.
              Passive VR had no analgesic effect. Age was significantly
              correlated to pain scores, with older subjects demonstrating
              larger effects of VR. Gender, game experience, and susceptibility
              for immersion, did not influence VR analgesia. CONCLUSION: Active
              VR decreases pre-perceptual and perceptual brain activity
              following painful electrical stimuli, corresponding with reduced
              pain experience. VR has potential to serve as a non-pharmacologic

              virtual reality (VR) systems (i.e., head-mounted display; HMD) to
              be implemented in research and clinical settings, because of the
              presence of nausea, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue, and
              instability (i.e., VR induced symptoms and effects; VRISE).
              Research suggests that the duration of a VR session modulates the
              presence and intensity of VRISE, but there are no suggestions
              regarding the appropriate maximum duration of VR sessions. The
              implementation of high-end VR HMDs in conjunction with ergonomic
              VR software seems to mitigate the presence of VRISE
              substantially. However, a brief tool does not currently exist to
              appraise and report both the quality of software features and
              VRISE intensity quantitatively. The Virtual Reality Neuroscience
              Questionnaire (VRNQ) was developed to assess the quality of VR
              software in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game
              assistance, and VRISE. Forty participants aged between 28 and 43
              years were recruited (18 gamers and 22 non-gamers) for the study.
              They participated in 3 different VR sessions until they felt
              weary or discomfort and subsequently filled in the VRNQ. Our
              results demonstrated that VRNQ is a valid tool for assessing VR
              software as it has good convergent, discriminant, and construct
              validity. The maximum duration of VR sessions should be between
              55 and 70 min when the VR software meets or exceeds the
              parsimonious cut-offs of the VRNQ and the users are familiarized
              with the VR system. Also, the gaming experience does not seem to
              affect how long VR sessions should last. Also, while the quality
              of VR software substantially modulates the maximum duration of VR
              sessions, age and education do not. Finally, deeper immersion,
              better quality of graphics and sound, and more helpful in-game
              instructions and prompts were found to reduce VRISE intensity.
              The VRNQ facilitates the brief assessment and reporting of the
              quality of VR software features and/or the intensity of VRISE,
              while its minimum and parsimonious cut-offs may appraise the
              suitability of VR software for implementation in research and

              people with physical disabilities. Especially, in the myoelectric
              interfaces for robotic hands or arms, decoding the user's
              upper-limb movement intentions is cardinal to properly control
              the prosthesis. However, because previous experiments were

              classifying reaching-to-grasping based on the EMG signals from
              the residual limb without the below-elbow muscles was not

              possibility of classifying reaching-to-grasping tasks using the
              EMG from the upper arm and upper body without considering wrist
              muscles for prosthetic users. In our study, seven healthy

              tasks based on the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP)
              with 12 different weighted (light and heavy) objects. The
              acquired EMG was processed using the principal component analysis
              (PCA) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to decode the tasks.
              The PCA-CNN method showed that the average accuracies of the
              healthy subjects were 69.4 $\pm$ 11.4\%, using only the EMG
              signals by the upper arm and upper body. The result with the
              PCA-CNN method showed 8\% significantly higher accuracies than
              the result with the widely used time domain and
              auto-regressive-support vector machine (TDAR-SVM) method as 61.6
              $\pm$ 13.7\%. However, in the cases of the amputees, the PCA-CNN
              showed slightly lower performance. In addition, in the aspects of
              assistant daily living, because grip force is also important when
              grasping an object after reaching, the possibility of classifying
              the two light and heavy objects in each reaching-to-grasping task
              was also investigated. Consequently, the PCA-CNN method showed
              higher accuracy at 70.1 $\pm$ 9.8\%. Based on our results, the
              PCA-CNN method can help to improve the performance of classifying
              reaching-to-grasping tasks without wrist EMG signals. Our
              findings and decoding method can be implemented to further

  abstract = "Joint applications of virtual reality (VR) systems and
              electroencephalography (EEG) offer numerous new possibilities
              ranging from behavioral science to therapy. VR systems allow for
              highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a
              non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged
              temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly
              susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM
              noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has
              not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a
              structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful
              to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the
              frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in healthy
              subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of
              conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs.
              eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked
              brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive
              potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the
              HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The
              results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artifacts,
              especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of
              90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range
              that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and
              applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected.
              Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings,
              at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with
              the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially
              available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to
              thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most
              likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a
              structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary
              devices.",

              integration and interpretation of sensory input from multiple
              sources with respect to existing representations of the bodily
              self. Illusion paradigms involving multisensory manipulations
              have demonstrated that while the senses of ownership and agency
              are strongly related, these two components of bodily experience
              may be dissociable and differentially affected by alterations to
              sensory input. Importantly, however, much of the current
              literature has focused on the application of sensory
              manipulations to external objects or virtual representations of
              the self that are visually incongruent with the viewer's own body
              and which are not part of the existing body representation. The
              current experiment used MIRAGE-mediated reality to investigate
              how manipulating the visual, spatial and temporal properties of
              the participant's own hand (as opposed to a fake/virtual limb)
              affected embodiment and action. Participants viewed two
              representations of their right hand inside a MIRAGE multisensory
              illusions box with opposing visual (normal or grossly distorted),
              temporal (synchronous or asynchronous) and spatial (precise real
              location or false location) manipulations applied to each hand.
              Subjective experiences of ownership and agency towards each hand
              were measured alongside an objective measure of perceived hand
              location using a pointing task. The subjective sense of agency
              was always anchored to the synchronous hand, regardless of
              physical appearance and location. Subjective ownership also moved
              with the synchronous hand, except when both the location and
              appearance of the synchronous limb were incongruent with that of
              the real limb. Objective pointing measures displayed a similar
              pattern, however movement synchrony was not sufficient to drive a
              complete shift in perceived hand location, indicating a greater
              reliance on the spatial location of the real hand. The results
              suggest that while the congruence of self-generated movement is a
              sufficient driver for the sense of agency, the sense of ownership

              intensive task-oriented training, it may also lead to slacking
              when the assistance is too supportive. Preserving the engagement
              of the patients while providing ``assistance-as-needed'' during
              the exercises, therefore remains an ongoing challenge. We applied
              a commercially available seven degree-of-freedom arm exoskeleton
              to provide passive gravity compensation during task-oriented
              training in a virtual environment. During this 4-week pilot
              study, five severely affected chronic stroke patients performed
              reach-to-grasp exercises resembling activities of daily living.
              The subjects received virtual reality feedback from their
              three-dimensional movements. The level of difficulty for the
              exercise was adjusted by a performance-dependent real-time
              adaptation algorithm. The goal of this algorithm was the
              automated improvement of the range of motion. In the course of 20
              training and feedback sessions, this unsupervised adaptive
              training concept led to a progressive increase of the virtual
              training space (p < 0.001) in accordance with the subjects'
              abilities. This learning curve was paralleled by a concurrent
              improvement of real world kinematic parameters, i.e., range of
              motion (p = 0.008), accuracy of movement (p = 0.01), and movement
              velocity (p < 0.001). Notably, these kinematic gains were
              paralleled by motor improvements such as increased elbow movement
              (p = 0.001), grip force (p < 0.001), and upper extremity

              adaptive closed-loop feedback in virtual reality provides
              customized rehabilitation environments for severely affected
              stroke patients. This approach may facilitate motor learning by
              progressively challenging the subject in accordance with the
              individual capacity for functional restoration. It might be
              necessary to apply concurrent restorative interventions to

               predictability for natural images based on self-supervised,

               were mainly modulated by the contextual predictability of
               higher-order image features, which correlated strongly with
               human perceptual similarity judgments. By contrast, V1 gamma
               ($\gamma$)-synchronization increased monotonically with the
               contextual predictability of low-level image features and
               emerged exclusively for larger stimuli. Consequently,
               $\gamma$-synchronization was induced by natural images that are
               highly compressible and low-dimensional. Natural stimuli with
               low predictability induced prominent, late-onset beta
               ($\beta$)-synchronization, likely reflecting cortical feedback.

              from five different European centers to identify predictors of
              outcome and to identify an optimal stimulation site. METHODS: We
              analysed retrospectively baseline covariates, pre- and
              postoperative clinical tremor scores (12-month) as well as
              individual imaging data from 119 patients to obtain individual
              electrode positions and stimulation volumes. Individual imaging
              and clinical data was used to calculate a probabilistic
              stimulation map in normalized space using voxel-wise statistical
              analysis. Finally, we used this map to train a classifier to
              predict tremor improvement. RESULTS: Probabilistic mapping of
              stimulation effects yielded a statistically significant cluster
              that was associated with a tremor improvement greater than 50\%.
              This cluster of optimal stimulation extended from the posterior
              subthalamic area to the ventralis intermedius nucleus and
              coincided with a normative structural-connectivity-based

              between the stimulation volume and the significant cluster'' and
              ``CTT activation'' were used as a predictor of tremor
              improvement. This correctly classified a greater than 50\% tremor
              improvement with a sensitivity of 89\% and a specificity of 57\%.

              of knowledge acquisition that draws attention in both
              neuroscience and artificial intelligence. To investigate its
              underlying brain mechanism, we trained a recurrent neural network
              model on arbitrary sensorimotor mappings. The network displayed
              an exponential speedup in learning. The neural substrate of a
              schema emerges within a low-dimensional subspace of population
              activity. Its reuse in new problems facilitates learning by
              limiting connection weight changes. Since the population

              stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor (ET) from 5 different
              European centers to identify predictors of outcome and to
              identify an optimal stimulation site. METHODS: We analyzed
              retrospectively baseline covariates, pre- and postoperative
              clinical tremor scores (for 12 months) as well as individual
              imaging data from 119 patients to obtain individual electrode
              positions and stimulation volumes. Individual imaging and
              clinical data were used to calculate a probabilistic stimulation
              map in normalized space using voxel-wise statistical analysis.
              Finally, we used this map to train a classifier to predict tremor
              improvement. RESULTS: Probabilistic mapping of stimulation
              effects yielded a statistically significant cluster that was
              associated with a tremor improvement >50\%. This cluster of
              optimal stimulation extended from the posterior subthalamic area
              to the ventralis intermedius nucleus and coincided with a
              normative structural connectivity-based cerebellothalamic tract
              (CTT). The combined features ``distance between the stimulation
              volume and the significant cluster'' and ``CTT activation'' were
              used as a predictor of tremor improvement. This correctly
              classified a >50\% tremor improvement with a sensitivity of 89\%
              and a specificity of 57\%. INTERPRETATION: Our multicenter ET
              probabilistic stimulation map identified an area of optimal

              studying spatial cognition. AR combines the best features of real
              and VR paradigms by allowing subjects to learn spatial
              information in a flexible fashion while walking through a
              real-world environment. To compare these methods, we had subjects

              Although subjects showed good performance in both, subjects
              reported that the AR task version was significantly easier, more
              immersive, and more fun than VR. Importantly, memory performance
              was significantly better in AR compared to VR. Our findings

              challenges popular conceptions of human agency. It also raises
              fundamental questions for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that
              traditionally assume that neural activity reflects the user's
              conscious intentions. Here, we study the timing of human
              posterior parietal cortex single-neuron activity recorded from
              implanted microelectrode arrays relative to the explicit urge to
              initiate movement. Participants were free to choose when to move,
              whether to move, and what to move, and they retrospectively
              reported the time they felt the urge to move. We replicate prior
              studies by showing that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) neural
              activity sharply rises hundreds of milliseconds before the
              reported urge. However, we find that this ``preconscious''
              activity is part of a dynamic neural population response that
              initiates much earlier, when the participant first chooses to
              perform the task. Together with details of neural timing, our
              results suggest that PPC encodes an internal model of the motor
              planning network that transforms high-level task objectives into
              appropriate motor behavior. These new data challenge traditional
              interpretations of early neural activity and offer a more
              holistic perspective on the interplay between choice, behavior,
              and their neural underpinnings. Our results have important
              implications for translating BMIs into more complex real-world
              environments. We find that early neural dynamics are sufficient
              to drive BMI movements before the participant intends to initiate
              movement. Appropriate algorithms ensure that BMI movements align

              as part of a brain-machine interface system to provide sensory
              feedback control of an artificial limb to assist persons with
              tetraplegia. Variability in functionality of electrodes has been
              reported but few studies in humans have examined the impact of
              chronic brain tissue responses revealed postmortem on electrode
              performancein vivo. Approach.In a tetraplegic man, recording MEAs
              were implanted into the anterior intraparietal area and
              Brodmann's area 5 (BA5) of the posterior parietal cortex and a
              recording and stimulation array was implanted in BA1 of the
              primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The participant expired from
              unrelated causes seven months after MEA implantation. The
              underlying tissue of two of the three devices was processed for
              histology and electrophysiological recordings were assessed.Main
              results.Recordings of neuronal activity were obtained from all
              three MEAs despite meningeal encapsulation. However, the S1 array
              had a greater encapsulation, yielded lower signal quality than
              the other arrays and failed to elicit somatosensory percepts with
              electrical stimulation. Histological examination of tissues
              underlying S1 and BA5 implant sites revealed localized
              leptomeningeal proliferation and fibrosis, lymphocytic
              infiltrates, astrogliosis, and foreign body reaction around the
              electrodes. The BA5 recording site showed focal cerebral
              microhemorrhages and leptomeningeal vascular ectasia. The S1 site
              showed focal tissue damage including vascular recanalization,
              neuronal loss, and extensive subcortical white matter necrosis.
              The tissue response at the S1 site included hemorrhagic-induced
              injury suggesting a likely mechanism for reduced function of the
              S1 implant.Significance.Our findings are similar to those from

              that vascular disruption and microhemorrhage during device
              implantation are important contributors to overall array and

              naturalistic sensations. However, the neurophysiological
              mechanisms underlying the evoked sensations remain unknown. To
              understand how specific stimulation parameters elicit certain
              sensations we must first understand the representation of those
              sensations in the brain. In this study we record from
              intracortical microelectrode arrays implanted in S1, premotor
              cortex, and posterior parietal cortex of a male human participant
              performing a somatosensory imagery task. The sensations imagined
              were those previously elicited by ICMS of S1, in the same array
              of the same participant. In both spike and local field potential
              recordings, features of the neural signal can be used to classify
              different imagined sensations. These features are shown to be
              stable over time. The sensorimotor cortices only encode the
              imagined sensation during the imagery task, while posterior
              parietal cortex encodes the sensations starting with cue
              presentation. These findings demonstrate that different aspects
              of the sensory experience can be individually decoded from
              intracortically recorded human neural signals across the cortical
              sensory network. Activity underlying these unique sensory

              precisely eliciting specific sensations via ICMS in future
              work.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Electrical stimulation of human
              cortex is increasingly more common for providing feedback in
              neural devices. Understanding the relationship between naturally
              evoked and artificially evoked neurophysiology for the same
              sensations will be important in advancing such devices. Here, we
              investigate the neural activity in human primary somatosensory,
              premotor, and parietal cortices during somatosensory imagery. The
              sensations imagined were those previously elicited during
              intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the same somatosensory
              electrode array. We elucidate the neural features during
              somatosensory imagery that significantly encode different aspects
              of individual sensations and demonstrate feature stability over
              almost a year. The correspondence between neurophysiology
              elicited with or without stimulation for the same sensations will
              inform methods to deliver more precise feedback through
              stimulation in the future.",

              being in control of it - and the possibility of experimentally
              manipulating it. For instance, an illusory feeling of embodiment
              towards a fake hand can be triggered by providing synchronous
              visuo-tactile stimulation to the hand of participants and to a
              fake hand or by asking participants to move their hand and
              observe a fake hand moving accordingly (rubber hand illusion).
              Here, we tested whether it is possible to manipulate embodiment
              not through stimulation of the participant's hand, but by
              directly tapping into the brain's hand representation via
              non-invasive brain stimulation. To this aim, we combined
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to activate the hand
              corticospinal representation, with virtual reality (VR), to
              provide matching (as contrasted to non-matching) visual feedback,
              mimicking involuntary hand movements evoked by TMS. We show that
              the illusory embodiment occurred when TMS pulses were temporally
              matched with VR feedback, but not when TMS was administered
              outside primary motor cortex, (over the vertex) or when
              stimulating motor cortex at a lower intensity (that did not
              activate peripheral muscles). Behavioural (questionnaires) and
              neurophysiological (motor-evoked-potentials,
              TMS-evoked-movements) measures further indicated that embodiment
              was not explained by stimulation per se, but depended on the
              temporal coherence between TMS-induced activation of hand
              corticospinal representation and the virtual bodily feedback.
              This reveals that non-invasive brain stimulation may replace the

               mostly zeros. In contrast, humans are good at assessing and
               predicting the future consequences of actions and can serve as
               good reward/policy shapers to accelerate the robot learning
               process. Previous works have shown that the human brain
               generates an error-related signal, measurable using
               electroencephelography (EEG), when the human perceives the task
               being done erroneously. In this work, we propose a method that
               uses evaluative feedback obtained from human brain signals
               measured via scalp EEG to accelerate RL for robotic agents in
               sparse reward settings. As the robot learns the task, the EEG of
               a human observer watching the robot attempts is recorded and
               decoded into noisy error feedback signal. From this feedback, we
               use supervised learning to obtain a policy that subsequently
               augments the behavior policy and guides exploration in the early
               stages of RL. This bootstraps the RL learning process to enable
               learning from sparse reward. Using a simple robotic navigation
               task as a test bed, we show that our method achieves a stable
               obstacle-avoidance policy with high success rate, outperforming
               learning from sparse rewards only that struggles to achieve
               obstacle avoidance behavior or fails to advance to the goal.",

               This paper proposes to use brain activity recorded by an

              restore motor function with upper-limb neuroprostheses requires
              that somatosensory feedback be provided to the tetraplegic
              patient or amputee. Given the complexity of state-of-the-art
              prosthetic limbs and, thus, the huge state space they can
              traverse, it is desirable to minimize the need for the patient to
              learn associations between events impinging on the limb and
              arbitrary sensations. Accordingly, we have developed approaches
              to intuitively convey sensory information that is critical for
              object manipulation--information about contact location,
              pressure, and timing--through intracortical microstimulation of
              primary somatosensory cortex. In experiments with nonhuman
              primates, we show that we can elicit percepts that are projected
              to a localized patch of skin and that track the pressure exerted
              on the skin. In a real-time application, we demonstrate that
              animals can perform a tactile discrimination task equally well

              or to a prosthetic one. Finally, we propose that the timing of
              contact events can be signaled through phasic intracortical
              microstimulation at the onset and offset of object contact that
              mimics the ubiquitous on and off responses observed in primary

              manipulation, but current upper limb prostheses do not provide
              such feedback to the user. For individuals who require use of
              prosthetic limbs, this lack of feedback transforms a mundane task
              into one that requires extreme concentration and effort. Although
              vibrotactile motors and sensory substitution devices can be used
              to convey gross sensations, a direct neural interface is required
              to provide detailed and intuitive sensory feedback. The viability
              of intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) as a method to deliver
              feedback depends in part on the long-term reliability of
              implanted electrodes used to deliver the stimulation. The
              objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of
              chronic ICMS on the electrode-tissue interface. APPROACH: We
              stimulate the primary somatosensory cortex of three Rhesus
              macaques through chronically implanted electrodes for 4 h per day
              over a period of six months, with different electrodes subjected
              to different regimes of stimulation. We measure the impedance and
              voltage excursion as a function of time and of ICMS parameters.
              We also test the sensorimotor consequences of chronic ICMS by
              having animals grasp and manipulate small treats. MAIN RESULTS:
              We show that impedance and voltage excursion both decay with time
              but stabilize after 10-12 weeks. The magnitude of this decay is
              dependent on the amplitude of the ICMS and, to a lesser degree,
              the duration of individual pulse trains. Furthermore, chronic
              ICMS does not produce any deficits in fine motor control.
              SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that chronic ICMS has only a
              minor effect on the electrode-tissue interface and may thus be a
              viable means to convey sensory feedback in neuroprosthetics.",

              cortex evokes sensory perceptions, and is thus a promising option
              for closing the loop. Before this can be implemented in humans it
              is necessary to evaluate how changes in stimulus parameters are
              perceived and the extent to which they can be discriminated.

              between stimuli of different frequency and amplitude as well as

              autonomy and quality of life. An approach that decodes words and
              sentences directly from the cerebral cortical activity of such
              patients may represent an advancement over existing methods for
              assisted communication. METHODS: We implanted a subdural,
              high-density, multielectrode array over the area of the
              sensorimotor cortex that controls speech in a person with
              anarthria (the loss of the ability to articulate speech) and
              spastic quadriparesis caused by a brain-stem stroke. Over the
              course of 48 sessions, we recorded 22 hours of cortical activity
              while the participant attempted to say individual words from a
              vocabulary set of 50 words. We used deep-learning algorithms to
              create computational models for the detection and classification
              of words from patterns in the recorded cortical activity. We
              applied these computational models, as well as a natural-language
              model that yielded next-word probabilities given the preceding
              words in a sequence, to decode full sentences as the participant
              attempted to say them. RESULTS: We decoded sentences from the
              participant's cortical activity in real time at a median rate of
              15.2 words per minute, with a median word error rate of 25.6\%.
              In post hoc analyses, we detected 98\% of the attempts by the
              participant to produce individual words, and we classified words
              with 47.1\% accuracy using cortical signals that were stable
              throughout the 81-week study period. CONCLUSIONS: In a person
              with anarthria and spastic quadriparesis caused by a brain-stem
              stroke, words and sentences were decoded directly from cortical
              activity during attempted speech with the use of deep-learning
              models and a natural-language model. (Funded by Facebook and

              translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for

              Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to

              translation, orientation and one-dimensional grasping control of
              a prosthetic limb (seven degrees of freedom) by a human subject
              with tetraplegia using a brain-machine interface (BMI). The
              current study, in the same subject, immediately followed the
              previous work and expanded the scope of the control signal by
              also extracting hand-shape commands from the two 96-channel
              intracortical electrode arrays implanted in the subject's left
              motor cortex. APPROACH: Four new control signals, dictating
              prosthetic hand shape, replaced the one-dimensional grasping in
              the previous study, allowing the subject to control the
              prosthetic limb with ten degrees of freedom (three-dimensional
              (3D) translation, 3D orientation, four-dimensional hand shaping)
              simultaneously. MAIN RESULTS: Robust neural tuning to hand
              shaping was found, leading to ten-dimensional (10D) performance
              well above chance levels in all tests. Neural unit preferred
              directions were broadly distributed through the 10D space, with
              the majority of units significantly tuned to all ten dimensions,
              instead of being restricted to isolated domains (e.g.
              translation, orientation or hand shape). The addition of hand
              shaping emphasized object-interaction behavior. A fundamental
              component of BMIs is the calibration used to associate neural
              activity to intended movement. We found that the presence of an
              object during calibration enhanced successful shaping of the
              prosthetic hand as it closed around the object during grasping.
              SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that individual motor cortical
              neurons encode many parameters of movement, that object
              interaction is an important factor when extracting these signals,
              and that high-dimensional operation of prosthetic devices can be
              achieved with simple decoding algorithms. ClinicalTrials.gov

              decoder training is one strategy to create a model stable over
              time. Adaptive decoders update their parameters with new incoming

              tensor-based recursive exponentially weighted Markov-switching
              multi-linear model (REW-MSLM) decoder is proposed. REW-MSLM uses

              injuries result in tetraplegia. Neuroprosthetics are being
              developed to manage this condition and thus improve the lives of
              patients. We aimed to test the feasibility of a semi-invasive
              technique that uses brain signals to drive an exoskeleton.
              METHODS: We recruited two participants at Clinatec research
              centre, associated with Grenoble University Hospital, Grenoble,
              France, into our ongoing clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were
              age 18-45 years, stability of neurological deficits, a need for
              additional mobility expressed by the patient, ambulatory or
              hospitalised monitoring, registration in the French social
              security system, and signed informed consent. The exclusion
              criteria were previous brain surgery, anticoagulant treatments,
              neuropsychological sequelae, depression, substance dependence or
              misuse, and contraindications to magnetoencephalography (MEG),
              EEG, or MRI. One participant was excluded because of a technical
              problem with the implants. The remaining participant was a
              28-year-old man, who had tetraplegia following a C4-C5 spinal
              cord injury. Two bilateral wireless epidural recorders, each with
              64 electrodes, were implanted over the upper limb sensorimotor
              areas of the brain. Epidural electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals
              were processed online by an adaptive decoding algorithm to send
              commands to effectors (virtual avatar or exoskeleton). Throughout
              the 24 months of the study, the patient did various mental tasks
              to progressively increase the number of degrees of freedom.
              FINDINGS: Between June 12, 2017, and July 21, 2019, the patient
              cortically controlled a programme that simulated walking and made
              bimanual, multi-joint, upper-limb movements with eight degrees of
              freedom during various reach-and-touch tasks and wrist rotations,
              using a virtual avatar at home (64·0\% [SD 5·1] success) or an

              with microelectrodes, epidural ECoG is semi-invasive and has
              similar efficiency. The decoding models were reusable for up to
              approximately 7 weeks without recalibration. INTERPRETATION:
              These results showed long-term (24-month) activation of a
              four-limb neuroprosthetic exoskeleton by a complete brain-machine
              interface system using continuous, online epidural ECoG to decode
              brain activity in a tetraplegic patient. Up to eight degrees of
              freedom could be simultaneously controlled using a unique model,
              which was reusable without recalibration for up to about 7 weeks.

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals have emerged as a
              potential control signal for brain-computer interface (BCI)
              applications due to balancing signal quality and implant
              invasiveness. While there have been numerous demonstrations in
              which ECoG signals were used to decode motor movements and to
              develop BCI systems, the extent of information that can be
              decoded has been uncertain. Therefore, we sought to determine if
              ECoG signals could be used to decode kinematics (speed, velocity,
              and position) of arm movements in 3D space. APPROACH: To
              investigate this, we designed a 3D center-out reaching task that
              was performed by five epileptic patients undergoing temporary
              placement of ECoG arrays. We used the ECoG signals within a
              hierarchical partial-least squares (PLS) regression model to
              perform offline prediction of hand speed, velocity, and position.
              MAIN RESULTS: The hierarchical PLS regression model enabled us to
              predict hand speed, velocity, and position during 3D reaching
              movements from held-out test sets with accuracies above chance in
              each patient with mean correlation coefficients between 0.31 and
              0.80 for speed, 0.27 and 0.54 for velocity, and 0.22 and 0.57 for
              position. While beta band power changes were the most significant
              features within the model used to classify movement and rest, the
              local motor potential and high gamma band power changes, were the
              most important features in the prediction of kinematic
              parameters. SIGNIFICANCE: We believe that this study represents
              the first demonstration that truly three-dimensional movements
              can be predicted from ECoG recordings in human patients.
              Furthermore, this prediction underscores the potential to develop
              BCI systems with multiple degrees of freedom in human patients

               quantum dynamical systems and desired control objectives are
               critical for many emerging quantum technologies. We develop a

               makes use of the known underlying Hamiltonian structure.
               Further, the biDMD can be modified to model both fast and slow
               sampling of control signals, the latter by way of stroboscopic

              the GlaxoSmithKline Bioelectronic Medicines effort are ushering
              in a new era of therapeutic electrical stimulation. These novel
              therapies are prompting a re-evaluation of established electrical
              thresholds for stimulation-induced tissue damage. APPROACH: In
              this review, we explore what is known and unknown in published
              literature regarding tissue damage from electrical stimulation.
              MAIN RESULTS: For macroelectrodes, the potential for tissue
              damage is often assessed by comparing the intensity of
              stimulation, characterized by the charge density and charge per
              phase of a stimulus pulse, with a damage threshold identified
              through histological evidence from in vivo experiments as
              described by the Shannon equation. While the Shannon equation has
              proved useful in assessing the likely occurrence of tissue
              damage, the analysis is limited by the experimental parameters of
              the original studies. Tissue damage is influenced by factors not
              explicitly incorporated into the Shannon equation, including
              pulse frequency, duty cycle, current density, and electrode size.
              Microelectrodes in particular do not follow the charge per phase
              and charge density co-dependence reflected in the Shannon
              equation. The relevance of these factors to tissue damage is
              framed in the context of available reports from modeling and in
              vivo studies. SIGNIFICANCE: It is apparent that emerging
              applications, especially with microelectrodes, will require
              clinical charge densities that exceed traditional damage
              thresholds. Experimental data show that stimulation at higher
              charge densities can be achieved without causing tissue damage,
              suggesting that safety parameters for microelectrodes might be
              distinct from those defined for macroelectrodes. However, these
              increased charge densities may need to be justified by bench,
              non-clinical or clinical testing to provide evidence of device
              safety.",

               G{\"u}{\c c}l{\"u} General description Although somatosensory
               system works in tandem with the motor system in biology, the
               majority of the prosthetics research and commercial efforts had
               focused on accommodating movement deficits. With the development
               of neuroprostheses in the last 15 years, it has become evident
               that somatosensory input (mainly as touch and proprioception) is
               essential for motor control, manipulating objects, and
               embodiment, in addition to its primary role for sensory
               perception. Somatosensory Feedback for Neuroprosthetics covers
               all relevant aspects to facilitate learning and doing research
               and development in the field. To understand the properties of
               the body to create viable solutions, this book starts with
               chapters reviewing the basic anatomy, physiology, and
               psychophysics of the somatosensory system, sensorimotor control,
               and instrumentation. Some sections are dedicated to invasive
               (peripheral and central, mainly cortical) and noninvasive
               (vibrotactile, electrotactile, etc.) approaches. Final chapters
               cover future technologies such as novel sensors and electrodes,
               safety, and clinical testing, and help to make up future
               prospects for this field with an emphasis on development and end
               use. With contributions from renowned experts, the contents
               include their recent findings and technical details necessary to

              principles for non-invasive vibrotactile feedback signalling
              discrete transition events (e.g., extension to flexion) during
              use of prostheses, especially for the upper limbs.Materials and
              methods: Two vibrotactile actuators were used on both upper arms
              of 10 able-bodied human participants. Absolute thresholds,
              psychometric functions, and magnitude estimates were measured to
              equalize the sensation magnitudes for the tested vibrotactile
              frequencies and skin sites. Then, same-different and pattern
              recognition tasks were run to evaluate, respectfully, the
              discrimination and closed-set identification of stimuli with
              varying parameters (2 frequencies, 2 magnitudes, 2 sites).
              Finally, parameters of the left/right stimuli were mapped to
              hypothetical prosthesis events representing object/force and
              movement type. The stimuli were applied sequentially in
              accordance with the discrete event-driven feedback
              paradigm.Results: Reliable psychophysical models could be
              established for individual participants as verified by repetitive
              threshold measurements and relative adjustment of stimulus levels
              based on sensation magnitudes. Discrimination accuracy was higher
              for magnitude versus frequency comparisons; and magnitude
              discrimination accuracy was correlated with magnitude estimate
              differences. Pattern recognition recall/precision rates decreased
              from ∼0.7 to ∼0.5 for sequential delivery of two stimulus
              patterns to one arm versus to two arms. Using the patterns as two
              and three consecutive prosthesis events yielded statistically
              similar performance rates not correlated with magnitude estimate
              differences.Conclusions: By careful calibration of stimuli based
              on psychophysical principles, discrete event-driven vibrotactile
              feedback can be used to signal manipulated object and movement
              information with moderate identification rates as shown by

              sensory modalities. For instance, both vision and proprioception
              provide information about hand position, and this information is
              integrated to generate a single estimate of where the hand is in
              space. Classically, vision has been thought to dominate this
              process, with the estimate of hand position relying more on
              vision than on proprioception. However, an optimal integration
              model that takes into account the precision of vision and

              Variation with direction was so strong that, in the depth

              conclude that the responses of populations of somatosensory

              consolidation. However, our understanding of neural dynamics
              during sleep and the role of prominent LFP frequency bands remain
              incomplete. To discern changes between different behavioral
              states we collected multichannel LFP and spike data in primary
              motor cortex of unconstrained macaques for up to 24 hours using
              the Neurochip3. Each 8 second bin of time was classified into
              awake and moving (Move), awake and at rest (Rest), REM sleep
              (REM), or non-REM sleep (NREM) by using dimensionality reduction
              and clustering on the average spectral density and the
              acceleration of the head. LFP power showed high delta during
              NREM, high theta during REM, and high beta when the animal was
              awake. Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling typically showed
              higher coupling for deeper sleep between all pairs of frequency
              bands except for high delta-high gamma and theta-high gamma
              coupling during Move, and high theta-beta coupling during REM.
              Sorted single units showed decreased firing rate with deeper
              sleep, though with higher ``bursty'' patterns during NREM
              compared to other states. Spike-LFP synchrony showed high delta
              synchrony during Move, and higher coupling with all other
              frequency bands during NREM. These results altogether are
              consistent with previous findings showing reactivation of

  abstract = "Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is commonly used in many
              experimental and clinical paradigms; however, its effects on the
              activation of neurons are still not completely understood. To
              document the responses of cortical neurons in non-human primates
              to stimulation, we recorded single unit activity while delivering
              single-pulse stimulation via Utah arrays implanted in primary
              motor cortex of three macaque monkeys. Stimuli between 5-50
              $\mu$A delivered to single channels reliably evoked spikes in
              neurons recorded throughout the array with delays of up to 12
              milliseconds. ICMS pulses also induced a period of inhibition
              lasting up to 150 ms that typically followed the initial
              excitatory response. Higher current amplitudes led to a greater
              probability of evoking a spike and extended the duration of
              inhibition. The likelihood of evoking a spike in a neuron was
              dependent on the spontaneous firing rate as well as the delay
              between its most recent spike time and stimulus onset. Tonic
              repetitive stimulation between 2 and 20 Hz often modulated both
              the probability of evoking spikes and the duration of inhibition,
              although high frequency stimulation in particular was more likely
              to change both responses. On a trial-by-trial basis, whether a
              stimulus evoked a spike did not affect the subsequent inhibitory
              response; however, their changes over time were frequently
              positively or negatively correlated. Our results document the
              complex dynamics of cortical neural responses to electrical
              stimulation that need to be considered when utilizing ICMS for
              scientific and clinical applications. Significance statement
              Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is commonly used to probe
              the cortex, and previous studies have characterized the responses
              of single neurons to ICMS. However, these studies typically
              explored the averaged effects of ICMS throughout each
              experimental session, rather than by a trial-by-trial basis for
              each stimulation pulse. By shifting the approach, we explored the
              dependence of neural responses to ICMS on the spontaneous neural
              activity as well as the dynamics of responses over time due to
              repetitive stimulation. Our results highlight how the responses
              of neurons to ICMS are likely the result of interactions between
              local excitatory and inhibitory cortical circuits. These results
              will help inform the design of ICMS for both basic research and
              clinically relevant stimulation protocols. \#\#\# Competing

              microstimulation may provide a basis for rapid movement-related
              feedback",
  author   = "Sombeck, Joseph T and Miller, Lee E",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Tetraplegic patients using brain-machine interfaces
              can make visually guided reaches with robotic arms. However,
              restoring proprioceptive feedback to these patients will be
              critical, as evidenced by the movement deficit in patients with
              proprioceptive loss. Proprioception is critical in large part
              because it provides faster feedback than vision. Intracortical
              microstimulation (ICMS) is a promising approach, but the
              ICMS-evoked reaction time (RT) is typically slower than that to
              natural proprioceptive and often even visual cues, implying that
              ICMS feedback may not be fast enough to guide movement. APPROACH:
              For most sensory modalities, RT decreases with increased stimulus
              intensity. Thus, it may be that stimulation intensities beyond
              what has previously been used will result in faster RTs. To test
              this, we compared the RT to ICMS applied through multi-electrode
              arrays in area 2 of somatosensory cortex to that of mechanical
              and visual cues. MAIN RESULTS: We found that the RT to
              single-electrode ICMS decreased with increased current,
              frequency, and train length. For 100 µA, 330 Hz stimulation, the
              highest single-electrode intensity we tested routinely, most
              electrodes resulted in RTs slower than the mechanical cue but
              slightly faster than the visual cue. While increasing the current
              beyond 100 µA resulted in faster RTs, sustained stimulation at
              this level may damage tissue. Alternatively, by stimulating
              through multiple electrodes (mICMS), a large amount of current
              can be injected while keeping that through each electrode at a
              safe level. We found that stimulation with at least 480 µA
              equally distributed over 16 electrodes could produce RTs as much
              as 20 ms faster than the mechanical cue, roughly the conduction
              delay to cortex from the periphery. SIGNIFICANCE: These results
              suggest that mICMS may provide a means to supply rapid,
              movement-related feedback. Future neuroprosthetics may need
              spatiotemporally patterned mICMS to convey useful somatosensory
              information. Novelty \& Significance Intracortical
              microstimulation (ICMS) is a promising approach for providing
              artificial somatosensation to patients with spinal cord injury or
              limb amputation, but in prior experiments, subjects have been
              unable to respond as quickly to it as to natural cues. We have
              investigated the use of multi-electrode stimulation (mICMS) and
              discovered that it can produce reaction times as fast or faster
              even than natural mechanical cues. Although our stimulus trains
              were not modulated in time, this result opens the door to more
              complex spatiotemporal patterns of mICMS that might be used to
              rapidly write in complex somatosensory information to the CNS.",

              number of challenges that limit their societal impact, ranging
              from the correct decoding of a human's thoughts, to the

              important engineering advances, the basic neuroscience behind

              effective, clinicians and researchers should optimize stimulation
              parameters according to desired outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The goal of
              our large-scale study was to comprehensively evaluate the effects
              of stimulation at different parameters and locations on neuronal
              activity across the human brain. METHODS: To examine how
              different kinds of stimulation affect human brain activity, we
              compared the changes in neuronal activity that resulted from
              stimulation at a range of frequencies, amplitudes, and locations
              with direct human brain recordings. We recorded human brain
              activity directly with electrodes that were implanted in
              widespread regions across 106 neurosurgical epilepsy patients
              while systematically stimulating across a range of parameters and
              locations. RESULTS: Overall, stimulation most often had an
              inhibitory effect on neuronal activity, consistent with earlier
              work. When stimulation excited neuronal activity, it most often
              occurred from high-frequency stimulation. These effects were
              modulated by the location of the stimulating electrode, with
              stimulation sites near white matter more likely to cause
              excitation and sites near gray matter more likely to inhibit
              neuronal activity. CONCLUSION: By characterizing how different
              stimulation parameters produced specific neuronal activity
              patterns on a large scale, our results provide an
              electrophysiological framework that clinicians and researchers

              limbs. We argue that the performance in controlling an
              end-effector using a BCI depends on three major factors: decoding
              error, missing somatosensory feedback and alignment error caused
              by translation and/or rotation of the end-effector relative to
              the real or perceived body. Using a virtual reality (VR) model of
              an ideal BCI decoder with healthy participants, we found that a
              significant performance loss might be attributed solely to the
              alignment error. We used a shape-drawing task to investigate and
              quantify the effects of robot arm misalignment on motor
              performance independent from the other error sources. We found
              that a 90° rotation of the robot arm relative to the participant
              leads to the worst performance, while we did not find a
              significant difference between a 45° rotation and no rotation.
              Additionally, we compared a group of subjects with indirect
              haptic feedback with a group without indirect haptic feedback to
              investigate the feedback-error. In the group without feedback, we
              found a significant difference in performance only when no
              rotation was applied to the robot arm, supporting that a form of
              haptic feedback is another important factor to be considered in
              BCI control.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Brain injury is the leading cause of long-term
              disability worldwide, often resulting in impaired hand function.
              Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) offer a potential way to improve
              hand function. BMIs often target replacing lost function, but may
              also be employed in neurorehabilitation (nrBMI) by facilitating
              neural plasticity and functional recovery. Here, we report a
              novel nrBMI capable of acquiring high-$\gamma$ (70-115 Hz)
              information through a unique post-TBI hemicraniectomy window
              model, and delivering sensory feedback that is synchronized with,
              and proportional to, intended grasp force. APPROACH: We developed
              the nrBMI to use electroencephalogram recorded over a
              hemicraniectomy (hEEG) in individuals with traumatic brain injury
              (TBI). The nrBMI empowered users to exert continuous,
              proportional control of applied force, and provided continuous
              force feedback. We report the results of an initial testing group
              of three human participants with TBI, along with a control group
              of three skull- and motor-intact volunteers. MAIN RESULTS: All
              participants controlled the nrBMI successfully, with high initial
              success rates (2 of 6 participants) or performance that improved
              over time (4 of 6 participants). We observed high-$\gamma$
              modulation with force intent in hEEG but not skull-intact EEG.
              Most significantly, we found that high-$\gamma$ control
              significantly improved the timing synchronization between neural
              modulation onset and nrBMI output/haptic feedback (compared to
              low-frequency nrBMI control). SIGNIFICANCE: These
              proof-of-concept results show that high-$\gamma$ nrBMIs can be
              used by individuals with impaired ability to control force
              (without immediately resorting to invasive signals like ECoG). Of
              note, the nrBMI includes a parameter to change the fraction of
              control shared between decoded intent and volitional force, to
              adjust for recovery progress. The improved synchrony between
              neural modulations and force control for high-$\gamma$ signals is
              potentially important for maximizing the ability of nrBMIs to
              induce plasticity in neural circuits. Inducing plasticity is
              critical to functional recovery after brain injury.",

              biological events. However, scattering processes limit the depth

              fibers and waveguides are commonly inserted into tissue when
              delivering light deeper than a few millimeters. This approach,
              however, introduces complications arising from tissue damage. In
              addition, it makes it difficult to steer light. Here, we
              demonstrate that ultrasound can be used to define and steer the

              pressure differences created by acoustic waves that result in
              refractive index contrasts. We show that virtual light pipes can

              We demonstrate the application of this technology in confining

              technology that may enable motor-impaired people to interact with

              hand function loss, which is the top priority for individuals
              with tetraplegia. Designing real-time and accurate BCI is crucial
              to make such devices useful, safe, and easy to use by patients in
              a real-life environment. Electrocorticography (ECoG)-based BCIs
              emerge as a good compromise between invasiveness of the recording
              device and good spatial and temporal resolution of the recorded
              signal. However, most ECoG signal decoders used to predict
              continuous hand movements are linear models. These models have a
              limited representational capacity and may fail to capture the
              relationship between ECoG signal features and continuous hand
              movements. Deep learning (DL) models, which are state-of-the-art

              relationship.Approach.In this study, we tested several DL-based
              architectures to predict imagined 3D continuous hand translation
              using time-frequency features extracted from ECoG signals. The

              short-term memory networks (LSTM). The accuracy of the DL-based

               applications in augmented reality, sports analytics,
               rehabilitation-healthcare, haptics etc. This paper presents
               NeuroPose, a system that shows the feasibility of 3D finger
               motion tracking using a platform of wearable ElectroMyoGraphy
               (EMG) sensors. EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from
               muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information
               for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However converting the
               sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since
               signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in
               complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses
               information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with
               machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks
               (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D
               finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern
               is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent.
               Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt
               a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal
               training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates
               a median error of 6.24° and a 90\%-ile error of 18.33° in
               tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to
               natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as
               changes in wrist positions of the user. NeuroPose is implemented
               on a smartphone with a processing latency of 0.101s, and a low

              standardized measurement error (SME)---to examine how data
              quality varies across different ERP paradigms, across individual
              participants, and across different procedures for quantifying
              amplitude and latency values. The EEG recordings were taken from
              the ERP CORE, which includes data from 40 neurotypical college
              students for seven widely studied ERP components: P3b, N170,
              mismatch negativity, N400, error-related negativity, N2pc, and
              lateralized readiness potential. Large differences in data
              quality were observed across the different ERP components, and
              very large differences in data quality were observed across
              participants. Data quality also varied depending on the algorithm

               processes are usually based on noninvasive techniques such as
               electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography or
               functional magnetic-resonance imaging. These techniques have
               either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and
               suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency
               sensitivity. Thus, they are suboptimal for exploring the
               short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the underlying
               brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of
               electrocorticography (ECoG) provides brain signals that have an
               exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to
               artifacts than EEG, and a high spatial and temporal resolution
               (i.e., <1 cm/<1 millisecond, respectively). ECoG involves
               measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that
               are implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent
               studies have shown that ECoG amplitudes in certain frequency
               bands carry substantial information about task-related activity,
               such as motor execution and planning, auditory processing and
               visual-spatial attention. Most of this information is captured
               in the high gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity
               has been proposed as a robust and general indicator of local
               cortical function. ECoG can also reveal functional connectivity
               and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics,
               thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical
               processes. It has especially proven useful for advancing
               brain-computer interfacing (BCI) technology for decoding a
               user's intentions to enhance or improve communication and
               control. Nevertheless, human ECoG data are often hard to obtain
               because of the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures
               involved, and the need to record within the constraints of
               clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to localize
               epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to
               collect human ECoG data. We describe our methods for collecting
               recording ECoG, and demonstrate how to use these signals for
               important real-time applications such as clinical mapping and
               brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the BCI2000
               software platform and the SIGFRIED method, an application for
               real-time mapping of brain functions. This procedure yields
               information that clinicians can subsequently use to guide the
               complex and laborious process of functional mapping by
               electrical stimulation. PREREQUISITES AND PLANNING: Patients
               with drug-resistant partial epilepsy may be candidates for
               resective surgery of an epileptic focus to minimize the
               frequency of seizures. Prior to resection, the patients undergo
               monitoring using subdural electrodes for two purposes: first, to
               localize the epileptic focus, and second, to identify nearby
               critical brain areas (i.e., eloquent cortex) where resection
               could result in long-term functional deficits. To implant
               electrodes, a craniotomy is performed to open the skull. Then,
               electrode grids and/or strips are placed on the cortex, usually
               beneath the dura. A typical grid has a set of 8 x 8
               platinum-iridium electrodes of 4 mm diameter (2.3 mm exposed
               surface) embedded in silicon with an inter-electrode distance of
               1cm. A strip typically contains 4 or 6 such electrodes in a
               single line. The locations for these grids/strips are planned by
               a team of neurologists and neurosurgeons, and are based on
               previous EEG monitoring, on a structural MRI of the patient's
               brain, and on relevant factors of the patient's history.
               Continuous recording over a period of 5-12 days serves to
               localize epileptic foci, and electrical stimulation via the
               implanted electrodes allows clinicians to map eloquent cortex.
               At the end of the monitoring period, explantation of the
               electrodes and therapeutic resection are performed together in
               one procedure. In addition to its primary clinical purpose,
               invasive monitoring also provides a unique opportunity to
               acquire human ECoG data for neuroscientific research. The
               decision to include a prospective patient in the research is
               based on the planned location of their electrodes, on the
               patient's performance scores on neuropsychological assessments,
               and on their informed consent, which is predicated on their
               understanding that participation in research is optional and is
               not related to their treatment. As with all research involving
               human subjects, the research protocol must be approved by the
               hospital's institutional review board. The decision to perform
               individual experimental tasks is made day-by-day, and is
               contingent on the patient's endurance and willingness to
               participate. Some or all of the experiments may be prevented by
               problems with the clinical state of the patient, such as
               post-operative facial swelling, temporary aphasia, frequent
               seizures, post-ictal fatigue and confusion, and more general
               pain or discomfort. At the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Albany
               Medical Center in Albany, New York, clinical monitoring is
               implemented around the clock using a 192-channel Nihon-Kohden
               Neurofax monitoring system. Research recordings are made in
               collaboration with the Wadsworth Center of the New York State
               Department of Health in Albany. Signals from the ECoG electrodes
               are fed simultaneously to the research and the clinical systems
               via splitter connectors. To ensure that the clinical and
               research systems do not interfere with each other, the two
               systems typically use separate grounds. In fact, an epidural
               strip of electrodes is sometimes implanted to provide a ground
               for the clinical system. Whether research or clinical recording
               system, the grounding electrode is chosen to be distant from the
               predicted epileptic focus and from cortical areas of interest
               for the research. Our research system consists of eight
               synchronized 16-channel g.USBamp amplifier/digitizer units
               (g.tec, Graz, Austria). These were chosen because they are
               safety-rated and FDA-approved for invasive recordings, they have
               a very low noise-floor in the high-frequency range in which the
               signals of interest are found, and they come with an SDK that
               allows them to be integrated with custom-written research
               software. In order to capture the high-gamma signal accurately,
               we acquire signals at 1200Hz sampling rate-considerably higher
               than that of the typical EEG experiment or that of many clinical
               monitoring systems. A built-in low-pass filter automatically
               prevents aliasing of signals higher than the digitizer can
               capture. The patient's eye gaze is tracked using a monitor with
               a built-in Tobii T-60 eye-tracking system (Tobii Tech.,
               Stockholm, Sweden). Additional accessories such as joystick,
               bluetooth Wiimote (Nintendo Co.), data-glove (5(th) Dimension
               Technologies), keyboard, microphone, headphones, or video camera
               are connected depending on the requirements of the particular
               experiment. Data collection, stimulus presentation,
               synchronization with the different input/output accessories, and
               real-time analysis and visualization are accomplished using our
               BCI2000 software. BCI2000 is a freely available general-purpose
               software system for real-time biosignal data acquisition,
               processing and feedback. It includes an array of pre-built
               modules that can be flexibly configured for many different
               purposes, and that can be extended by researchers' own code in
               C++, MATLAB or Python. BCI2000 consists of four modules that
               communicate with each other via a network-capable protocol: a
               Source module that handles the acquisition of brain signals from
               one of 19 different hardware systems from different
               manufacturers; a Signal Processing module that extracts relevant
               ECoG features and translates them into output signals; an
               Application module that delivers stimuli and feedback to the
               subject; and the Operator module that provides a graphical
               interface to the investigator. A number of different experiments
               may be conducted with any given patient. The priority of
               experiments will be determined by the location of the particular
               patient's electrodes. However, we usually begin our
               experimentation using the SIGFRIED (SIGnal modeling For Realtime
               Identification and Event Detection) mapping method, which
               detects and displays significant task-related activity in real
               time. The resulting functional map allows us to further tailor
               subsequent experimental protocols and may also prove as a useful
               starting point for traditional mapping by electrocortical
               stimulation (ECS). Although ECS mapping remains the gold
               standard for predicting the clinical outcome of resection, the
               process of ECS mapping is time consuming and also has other
               problems, such as after-discharges or seizures. Thus, a passive
               functional mapping technique may prove valuable in providing an
               initial estimate of the locus of eloquent cortex, which may then
               be confirmed and refined by ECS. The results from our passive
               SIGFRIED mapping technique have been shown to exhibit
               substantial concurrence with the results derived using ECS
               mapping. The protocol described in this paper establishes a
               general methodology for gathering human ECoG data, before
               proceeding to illustrate how experiments can be initiated using
               the BCI2000 software platform. Finally, as a specific example,
               we describe how to perform passive functional mapping using the
               BCI2000-based SIGFRIED system.",

              used in the surgical management of medically refractory partial
              epilepsies to identify the location and limits of the
              epileptogenic area, to guide the extent of resection, and to
              assess its completeness. Although in clinical use for many years,
              the basic questions regarding indications and limitations of this
              method has remained unanswered. ECoG plays a major role in
              tailored temporal lobectomies, whereas, it serves no practical
              purpose in standard resection of medial temporal lobe epilepsy
              (TLE) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of mesial
              temporal sclerosis (MTS). Residual hippocampal spikes, unaltered
              by resection, correlate with a greater proportion of seizure
              recurrence. Intraoperative hippocampal ECoG can allow sparing of
              functionally important hippocampus, thus minimising postoperative
              memory decline. ECoG eminently aids removal of developmental
              malformations of brain, and most importantly, the excision of
              highly epileptogenic cortical dysplasias (CDs) for deciding the
              extent of resection for best seizure control. The ECoG can be a

              based on analyses of patient electroencephalograms (EEGs) and by
              questionnaire responses after 6-8 weeks of patient involvement in
              our VR-based alleviation program. Clinical trials were performed
              at a tertiary academic hospital. Nineteen patients (aged 33-64
              years) who visited our hospital with chronic subjective tinnitus
              over 3 months were enrolled in the study. The intervention
              consisted of trashing the tinnitus avatar in VR. We expected that
              the patients would have the subjective feeling of controlling
              tinnitus through our intervention. The VR environment comprised
              four different sessions in four different settings: a bedroom, a
              living room, a restaurant, and a city street. We analyzed changes
              in the source activities of the prefrontal regions related to
              tinnitus in these patients using standardized low-resolution
              brain electromagnetic tomography. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory

              Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index also showed improved outcomes (P =

              Depression Scale, Profile of Mood States revealed no significant
              change after the intervention. The baseline EEG data showed that
              brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex significantly

              studies on the ``addition'' of supernumerary body parts. In this
              study, we developed a supernumerary robotic limb system that
              operates in a virtual environment, and then evaluated whether the
              extra limb can be regarded as a part of one's own body using a
              questionnaire and whether the perception of peripersonal space
              changes with a visuotactile crossmodal congruency task. We found
              that the participants can embody the extra-limbs after using the
              supernumerary robotic limb system. We also found a positive
              correlation between the perceptual change in the crossmodal
              congruency task and the subjective feeling that the number of
              one's arms had increased (supernumerary limb sensation). These
              results suggest that the addition of an extra body part may cause
              the participants to feel that they had acquired a new body part
              that differs from their original body part through a functional
              expansion.",

              that allows multi-modal, multi-agent interaction to study

              which provide an exceptionally powerful and tractable model
              system to study social communication. We show that pair-bonded
              zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) communicating through the

              of ten human participants at frequency-amplitude combinations
              that both elicited and failed to elicit conscious percepts,

              electrophysiological correlates of conscious perception have been
              shown to be reflected in the N1 component of the evoked response

              threshold-intensity somatosensory stimuli. We show here that

              preceded the perceived stimuli, indicating that the phase of

              proposed spatial extent of brain activity associated with
              conscious perception as well as in the assumed functional
              alterations within the involved brain regions. Here, we
              investigate which local and global changes in brain activity
              accompany conscious somatosensory perception following electrical
              finger nerve stimulation, and whether there are whole-brain
              functional network alterations by means of graph metrics.
              Thirty-eight healthy participants performed a somatosensory
              detection task and reported their decision confidence during
              fMRI. For conscious tactile perception in contrast to undetected
              near-threshold trials (misses), we observed increased BOLD
              activity in the precuneus, the intraparietal sulcus, the insula,
              the nucleus accumbens, the inferior frontal gyrus and the
              contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex. For misses compared
              to correct rejections, bilateral secondary somatosensory
              cortices, supplementary motor cortex and insula showed greater
              activations. The analysis of whole-brain functional network
              topology for hits, misses and correct rejections, did not result
              in any significant differences in modularity, participation,
              clustering or path length, which was supported by Bayes factor
              statistics. In conclusion, for conscious somatosensory
              perception, our results are consistent with an involvement of
              (probably) domain-general brain areas (precuneus, insula,
              inferior frontal gyrus) in addition to somatosensory regions; our
              data do not support the notion of specific changes in graph
              metrics associated with conscious experience. For the employed
              somatosensory submodality of fine electrical current stimulation,
              this speaks for a global broadcasting of sensory content across
              the brain without substantial reconfiguration of the whole-brain
              functional network resulting in an integrative conscious

              to consciousness) determine whether a near-threshold stimulus
              will be consciously perceived. In the present
              magnetoencephalography study, we scrutinised these pre-stimulus
              network states with a focus on the primary somatosensory cortex.
              For this purpose participants performed a simple near-threshold
              tactile detection task. Confirming previous studies, we found
              reduced alpha and beta power in the somatosensory region

              as compared to undetected stimuli, and stronger event-related

              an increased integration in the theta band, and additionally, a

              underline the importance of network states for enabling conscious

              stimulation (DES) is an increasingly common therapy for a wide
              variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. Unfortunately, therapeutic
              efficacy is inconsistent, likely due to our limited understanding
              of the relationship between the massive stimulation parameter
              space and brain tissue responses. OBJECTIVE: To better understand
              how different parameters induce varied neural responses, we
              systematically examined single pulse-induced cortico-cortico
              evoked potentials (CCEP) as a function of stimulation amplitude,
              duration, brain region, and whether grey or white matter was
              stimulated. METHODS: We measured voltage peak amplitudes and area
              under the curve (AUC) of intracranially recorded stimulation
              responses as a function of distance from the stimulation site,
              pulse width, current injected, location relative to grey and
              white matter, and brain region stimulated (N = 52, n = 719
              stimulation sites). RESULTS: Increasing stimulation pulse width
              increased responses near the stimulation location. Increasing
              stimulation amplitude (current) increased both evoked amplitudes
              and AUC nonlinearly. Locally (15 mm), white matter stimulation
              consistently produced larger responses than stimulation in or
              near grey matter. The stimulation location-response curves
              followed different trends for cingulate, lateral frontal, and
              lateral temporal cortical stimulation. CONCLUSION: These results
              demonstrate that a stronger local response may require
              stimulation in the grey-white boundary while stimulation in the
              white matter could be needed for network activation. Thus,
              stimulation parameters tailored for a specific

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Direct electrical stimulation of the brain through
              intracranial electrodes is currently used to probe the epileptic
              brain as part of pre-surgical evaluation, and it is also being
              considered for therapeutic treatments through neuromodulation. In
              order to effectively modulate neural activity, a given
              neuromodulation design must elicit similar responses throughout
              the course of treatment. However, it is unknown whether
              intracranial electrical stimulation responses are consistent
              across sessions. The objective of this study was to investigate
              the within-subject, cross-session consistency of the
              electrophysiological effect of electrical stimulation delivered
              through intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). APPROACH: We
              analysed data from 79 epilepsy patients implanted with iEEG who
              underwent brain stimulation as part of a memory experiment. We
              quantified the effect of stimulation in terms of band power
              modulation and compared this effect from session to session. As a
              reference, we made the same measurements during baseline periods.
              MAIN RESULTS: In most sessions, the effect of stimulation on band
              power could not be distinguished from baseline fluctuations of
              band power. Stimulation effect was consistent in a third of the
              session pairs, while the rest had a consistency measure not
              exceeding the baseline standards. Cross-session consistency was
              highly correlated with the degree of band power increase, and it
              also tended to be higher when the baseline conditions were more
              similar between sessions. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings can inform

              characteristics of head-mounted displays (HMDs) on simulator
              sickness (SS). BACKGROUND: Technological limitations, such as
              display delay and reduced field of view (FOV), affect perception
              when using an HMD and are often thought to be related to SS. Few
              studies have examined the relationship between FOV and geometric
              FOV (image scale factor) or how HMD characteristics may interact.
              METHOD: Participants made active head movements to locate objects
              when viewing a live video via an HMD. RESULTS: Compared with no
              added delay, an additional 200 ms of display delay did not result
              in increased SS, as measured by the Simulator Sickness
              Questionnaire. Furthermore, an effect of image scale factor on SS
              was not revealed. However, SS was greater when peripheral vision
              was occluded than when it was not. Peripheral vision moderated
              the effects of image scale factor and delay on head movement
              velocity. CONCLUSION: Occluding peripheral vision may subject HMD
              users to the potential detrimental consequences of HMD
              characteristics more than when peripheral vision of the external
              environment is available, resulting in more SS. Future research
              should investigate to what extent peripheral vision can be
              occluded without increasing SS and without sacrificing realism
              and presence. APPLICATION: To reduce the occurrence of SS, a
              degree of peripheral vision of the external world should be
              provided. Furthermore, users and designers should be aware that
              head movement behavior may be affected by HMD characteristics.",

              encourage children's exploration? Bridging insights from
              developmental psychology and the neuroscience of motor control,
              we examined the effects of parental praise on children's motor
              exploration. We theorize that modest praise can spark
              exploration. Unlike inflated praise, modest praise acknowledges
              children's performance, without setting a high standard for
              future performance. This may be reassuring to children with lower
              levels of self-esteem, who often doubt their ability. We
              conducted a novel virtual-reality experiment. Children (N = 202,

              However, how the brain dissociates these visual sensations
              remains unclear. We aimed to map the brain areas involved in
              internal and external visual sensations induced by intracranial

              differences. In this study, we collected subjective reports of

              stimulation in 40 drug-refractory epilepsy during presurgical
              evaluation. The response rate was calculated and compared to
              quantify the dissociated distribution of visual responses. We
              found that internal and external visual sensations could be
              elicited when different brain areas were stimulated, although
              there were more overlapping brain areas. Specifically,
              stimulation of the hippocampus and inferior temporal cortex

              the cortical information relevant to arm movements remaining in

              and estimate positions of imagined single-joint arm movements.
              Using visually guided motor imagery, the participant imagined
              performing eight distinct single-joint arm movements, while SUA,
              multispike trains (MSP), multiunit activity, and local field

  author    = "Franza, Matteo",
  abstract  = "Our brain constantly receives and integrates a flow of sensory
               and motor information that shapes the way our body is
               represented. Several experimental approaches have been proposed
               to alter the body representation, by manipulating exteroceptive
               or interoceptive bodily signals. During my thesis, I studied the
               contribution of central, rather than peripheral, motor brain
               mechanisms underlying bodily self-consciousness (BSC). For this
               purpose, I attempted to manipulate BSC, specifically inducing
               embodiment for a fake hand in healthy participants, by using a
               novel method that combines non-invasive transcranial magnetic
               stimulation (TMS) with immersive virtual reality (VR). First, we
               managed to induce embodiment for a virtual hand utilizing the
               spatio-temporal coherence between an artificial TMS-induced
               activation of the motor system and movement-related visual
               feedback in VR (Study 1). I observed that embodiment for a
               virtual hand was induced only when the provided stimulation is
               supra-threshold but not when TMS is delivered sub-threshold. I
               argue that such TMS-induced illusory embodiment is due to
               neuro-visual integration between TMS-induced primary motor
               cortex (M1) activation and hand twitches with visual VR
               feedback. In a second study (Study 2), by refining the
               parameters of our TMS-VR protocol we investigated the different
               peripheral components elicited by TMS with a special focus on
               hand perception. Our data revealed the main features of
               TMS-evoked hand perceptions (in terms of threshold and evoked
               subjective perceptions) and show that these are discernible from
               MEPs and TMS-evoked movements associated with single-pulse TMS
               over M1. Finally, we combined the TMS-VR setup (Study 1) and our
               stimulation protocol (Study 2) to investigate whether the
               awareness of peripheral bodily stimuli is necessary to induce
               changes in BSC (Study 3). Our findings reveal a prominent role
               of conscious bodily perceptions in triggering illusory
               embodiment, even in the absence of peripheral stimuli.
               Furthermore, I have been involved in other projects
               investigating the plasticity of body and space representation in
               healthy young and elderly participants (listed in appendix 1 \&
               2) and the robotically controlled induction of presence
               hallucinations (appendix 3). The present work provides important
               findings and promising tools regarding the role of non-invasive
               brain stimulation and virtual technology in the study of BSC. In
               particular, I showed that it is possible to manipulate BSC by
               directly stimulating the M1 cortical representation of the hand
               inducing embodiment for a virtual hand. Furthermore, I
               investigated the role of the TMS-evoked hand sensations and
               their role in the embodiment showing that the hand ownership is
               mainly driven by the detection of TMS stimuli on the hand.

               exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch,

              undertaken with a number of different animal models, as well as
              several human patients with quadriplegia. The resulting
              movements, whether of computer cursors or robotic limbs, remain
              quite slow and unstable compared to normal limb movements. It is
              an open question, how much of this instability is the result of
              the limited forward control path, and how much has to do with the
              total lack of normal proprioceptive feedback. We have begun
              preliminary studies of the effectiveness of electrical
              stimulation in the proprioceptive area of the primary
              somatosensory cortex (area 3a) as a potential means to deliver an
              artificial sense of proprioception to a monkey. We have
              demonstrated that it is possible for the monkey to detect brief
              stimulus trains at relatively low current levels, and to
              discriminate between trains of different frequencies. These
              observations need to be expanded to include more complex,
              time-varying waveforms that could potentially convey information
              about the state of the limb.",

              associated with worse reading performance (Schooler, Reichle, \&
              Halpern, 2004). Ironically, current methods for detecting these
              shifts of attention typically generate task interruptions and
              further disrupt performance. In the current study, we developed a
              method to (1) track shifts of attention away from the reading
              task by examining the similarity between 5 min of
              eyes-closed-resting-state EEG and 5 min reading EEG; and (2)
              investigate, during reading, how the ratio between attention
              shifts and focused reading relates to readers' comprehension. We
              performed a Spectral Similarity Analysis (SSA) that examined the
              spectral similarity between EEG recorded during reading and at
              rest on a moment-by-moment basis. We then recursively applied the
              algorithm to the resting-state data itself to obtain an
              individual baseline of the stability of brain activation recorded
              during rest. We defined any moment in which SSA during reading
              was greater than the mean correlation between resting-state EEG
              and itself as an ``attentional shift.'' The results showed that
              the proportion of such attentional shifts recorded over the left
              visual region (O1) significantly predicted reading comprehension,
              with higher ratios (indicative of more frequent attentional
              shifts) relating to worse comprehension scores on the reading
              test. As a proof of its validity, the same measure collected
              during the reading comprehension test also predicted
              participants' Simon effect (incongruent - congruent response
              times) which is a common index of selective attention. This novel
              method allows researchers to detect attention shifts moments

              effective in allowing patients with tetraplegia to regain control
              of hand movements and to achieve a greater measure of
              independence in daily activities. In existing clinical systems,
              the patient uses residual proximal limb movements to trigger

              with a constant decoder that transforms neural activity to

              the emergence of a surprisingly stable pattern of ensemble

              asynchronously, with one's own hand is perceived as actually
              being one's hand. We conducted a large-scale study of the RHI,

              perceived similarity between the participant's hand and the

              That is, embodiment leads to perceived similarity, but perceived
              similarity does not lead to embodiment. Furthermore, similarity
              ratings following the illusion were selectively correlated with
              some components of embodiment, but not with others. These results

              interfaces (BMI) have helped restore functionality and
              independence to individuals living with sensorimotor deficits;
              however, tasks requiring bimanual coordination and fine
              manipulation continue to remain unsolved given the technical
              complexity of controlling multiple degrees of freedom (DOF)
              across multiple limbs in a coordinated way through a user input.
              To address this challenge, we implemented a collaborative shared
              control strategy to manipulate and coordinate two Modular
              Prosthetic Limbs (MPL) for performing a bimanual self-feeding
              task. A human participant with microelectrode arrays in
              sensorimotor brain regions provided commands to both MPLs to
              perform the self-feeding task, which included bimanual cutting.
              Motor commands were decoded from bilateral neural signals to
              control up to two DOFs on each MPL at a time. The shared control
              strategy enabled the participant to map his four-DOF control
              inputs, two per hand, to as many as 12 DOFs for specifying robot
              end effector position and orientation. Using neurally-driven
              shared control, the participant successfully and simultaneously
              controlled movements of both robotic limbs to cut and eat food in
              a complex bimanual self-feeding task. This demonstration of
              bimanual robotic system control via a BMI in collaboration with
              intelligent robot behavior has major implications for restoring

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a portable
              and modular brain-computer interface (BCI) software platform
              independent of input and output devices. We implemented this
              platform in a case study of a subject with cervical spinal cord
              injury (C5 ASIA A). BACKGROUND: BCIs can restore independence for
              individuals with paralysis by using brain signals to control
              prosthetics or trigger functional electrical stimulation. Though
              several studies have successfully implemented this technology in
              the laboratory and the home, portability, device configuration,
              and caregiver setup remain challenges that limit deployment to
              the home environment. Portability is essential for transitioning
              BCI from the laboratory to the home. METHODS: The BCI platform
              implementation consisted of an Activa PC + S generator with two
              subdural four-contact electrodes implanted over the dominant left
              hand-arm region of the sensorimotor cortex, a minicomputer fixed
              to the back of the subject's wheelchair, a custom mobile phone
              application, and a mechanical glove as the end effector. To
              quantify the performance for this at-home implementation of the
              BCI, we quantified system setup time at home, chronic (14-month)
              decoding accuracy, hardware and software profiling, and Bluetooth
              communication latency between the App and the minicomputer. We
              created a dataset of motor-imagery labeled signals to train a
              binary motor imagery classifier on a remote computer for online,
              at-home use. RESULTS: Average bluetooth data transmission delay
              between the minicomputer and mobile App was 23 $\pm$ 0.014 ms.
              The average setup time for the subject's caregiver was 5.6 $\pm$
              0.83 min. The average times to acquire and decode neural signals
              and to send those decoded signals to the end-effector were
              respectively 404.1 ms and 1.02 ms. The 14-month median accuracy
              of the trained motor imagery classifier was 87.5 $\pm$ 4.71\%
              without retraining. CONCLUSIONS: The study presents the
              feasibility of an at-home BCI system that subjects can seamlessly
              operate using a friendly mobile user interface, which does not
              require daily calibration nor the presence of a technical person
              for at-home setup. The study also describes the portability of
              the BCI system and the ability to plug-and-play multiple end
              effectors, providing the end-user the flexibility to choose the
              end effector to accomplish specific motor tasks for daily needs.

              executed voluntary contractions of the extensor carpi radialis

              and compared left- and right-wrist-extensor-related activity
              throughout several sessions, comparing somatotopy of active
              electrodes, as well as neural signals both at the
              within-electrode (multiunit) and cross-electrode (network)
              levels. Wrist motions showed significant activation in motor and
              sensory cortical electrodes. Within electrodes, firing strength
              stability diminished as the time increased between consecutive
              measurements (hours within a session, or days across sessions),
              with higher stability observed in sensory cortex than in motor,
              and in the contralateral hemisphere than in the ipsilateral.
              However, we observed no differences at network level, and no
              evidence of decoding instabilities for wrist EMG, either across
              timespans of hours or days, or across recording area. While map
              stability differs between brain area and hemisphere at
              multiunit/electrode level, these differences are nullified at
              ensemble level.",

              is staged across six levels, including two preclinical stages
              (stages 1 and 2). AC stage 2 is defined by the presence of at

              symptoms. In contrast, AC stage 1 is defined by the absence of
              symptoms. METHODS: Initial empirical definitions for each symptom
              class were developed. These empirical criteria were then applied
              in a sample of 285 cognitively normal, amyloid-positive
              individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

              persons with abnormal amyloid. METHODS: The Mayo Clinic Study of
              Aging is a population-based longitudinal study of aging and
              cognitive impairment in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We evaluated
              persons without dementia having 3 consecutive clinical visits.
              Measures for cross-sectional categories included objective
              cognitive impairment (OBJ) and function (FXN). Measures for
              change included subjective cognitive impairment (SCD), objective
              cognitive change ($\Delta$OBJ), and new onset of neurobehavioral
              symptoms ($\Delta$NBS). We calculated frequencies of the stages
              using different cutoff points and assessed stability of the
              stages over 15 months. RESULTS: Among 243 abnormal amyloid
              participants, the frequencies of the stages varied with age: 66
              to 90\% were classified as stage 1 at age 50 but at age 80, 24 to
              36\% were stage 1, 32 to 47\% were stage 2, 18 to 27\% were stage
              3, 1 to 3\% were stage 4 to 6, and 3 to 9\% were indeterminate.
              Most stage 2 participants were classified as stage 2 because of
              abnormal $\Delta$OBJ only (44-59\%), whereas 11 to 21\% had SCD
              only, and 9 to 13\% had $\Delta$NBS only. Short-term stability
              varied by stage and OBJ cutoff points but the most notable
              changes were seen in stage 2 with 38 to 63\% remaining stable, 4
              to 13\% worsening, and 24 to 41\% improving (moving to stage 1).
              INTERPRETATION: The frequency of the stages varied by age and the
              precise membership fluctuated by the parameters used to define
              the stages. The staging framework may require revisions before it

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Recent advances in neural engineering have restored
              mobility to people with paralysis, relieved symptoms of movement
              disorders, reduced chronic pain, restored the sense of hearing,
              and provided sensory perception to individuals with sensory
              deficits. APPROACH: This progress was enabled by the team-based,
              interdisciplinary approaches used by neural engineers. Neural
              engineers have advanced clinical frontiers by leveraging tools
              and discoveries in quantitative and biological sciences and
              through collaborations between engineering, science, and
              medicine. The movement toward bioelectronic medicines, where
              neuromodulation aims to supplement or replace pharmaceuticals to
              treat chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure,
              diabetes and psychiatric disorders is a prime example of a new
              frontier made possible by neural engineering. Although one of the
              major goals in neural engineering is to develop technology for
              clinical applications, this technology may also offer unique
              opportunities to gain insight into how biological systems
              operate. MAIN RESULTS: Despite significant technological
              progress, a number of ethical and strategic questions remain
              unexplored. Addressing these questions will accelerate technology
              development to address unmet needs. The future of these devices
              extends far beyond treatment of neurological impairments,
              including potential human augmentation applications. Our task, as
              neural engineers, is to push technology forward at the
              intersection of disciplines, while responsibly considering the
              readiness to transition this technology outside of the laboratory
              to consumer products. SIGNIFICANCE: This article aims to
              highlight the current state of the neural engineering field, its
              links with other engineering and science disciplines, and the
              challenges and opportunities ahead. The goal of this article is
              to foster new ideas for innovative applications in

              for people with severe disabilities present stimuli in the visual
              modality with little consideration of the visual skills required
              for successful use. The primary objective of this tutorial is to
              present researchers and clinical professionals with basic
              information about the visual skills needed for functional use of
              visual BCIs, and to offer modifications that would render BCI
              technology more accessible for persons with vision
              impairments.Methods: First, we provide a background on BCIs that
              rely on a visual interface. We then describe the visual skills
              required for BCI technologies that are used for augmentative and
              alternative communication (AAC), as well as common eye conditions
              or impairments that can impact the user's performance. We
              summarize screening tools that can be administered by the non-eye
              care professional in a research or clinical setting, as well as
              the role of the eye care professional. Finally, we explore
              potential BCI design modifications to compensate for identified
              functional impairments. Information was generated from literature
              review and the clinical experience of vision experts.Results and
              conclusions: This in-depth description culminates in foundational
              information about visual skills and functional visual impairments
              that affect the design and use of visual interfaces for BCI
              technologies. The visual interface is a critical component of
              successful BCI systems. We can determine a BCI system for
              potential users with visual impairments and design BCI visual
              interfaces based on sound anatomical and physiological visual
              clinical science.Implications for RehabilitationAs brain-computer
              interfaces (BCIs) become possible access methods for people with
              severe motor impairments, it is critical that clinicians have a
              basic knowledge of the visual skills necessary for use of visual

              able to target also different neurological disorders. Given the
              rapid ageing of the population and the increase of invalidating
              diseases affecting the central nervous system, there is a growing
              demand for biomedical devices of immediate clinical use. However,
              to reach useful therapeutic results, these tools need a
              multidisciplinary approach and a continuous dialogue between
              neuroscience and engineering, a field that is named
              neuroengineering. This is because it is fundamental to understand
              how to read and perturb the neural code in order to produce a
              significant clinical outcome. RESULTS: In this review, we first
              highlight the importance of developing novel neurotechnological
              devices for brain repair and the major challenges expected in the
              next years. We describe the different types of brain repair
              strategies being developed in basic and clinical research and
              provide a brief overview of recent advances in artificial

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The array of available brain-computer interface (BCI)
              paradigms has continued to grow, and so has the corresponding set
              of machine learning methods which are at the core of BCI systems.
              The latter have evolved to provide more robust data analysis
              solutions, and as a consequence the proportion of healthy BCI
              users who can use a BCI successfully is growing. With this
              development the chances have increased that the needs and
              abilities of specific patients, the end-users, can be covered by
              an existing BCI approach. However, most end-users who have
              experienced the use of a BCI system at all have encountered a
              single paradigm only. This paradigm is typically the one that is
              being tested in the study that the end-user happens to be
              enrolled in, along with other end-users. Though this corresponds
              to the preferred study arrangement for basic research, it does
              not ensure that the end-user experiences a working BCI. In this
              study, a different approach was taken; that of a user-centered
              design. It is the prevailing process in traditional assistive
              technology. Given an individual user with a particular clinical
              profile, several available BCI approaches are tested and - if
              necessary - adapted to him/her until a suitable BCI system is
              found. METHODS: Described is the case of a 48-year-old woman who
              suffered from an ischemic brain stem stroke, leading to a severe
              motor- and communication deficit. She was enrolled in studies
              with two different BCI systems before a suitable system was
              found. The first was an auditory event-related potential (ERP)
              paradigm and the second a visual ERP paradigm, both of which are
              established in literature. RESULTS: The auditory paradigm did not
              work successfully, despite favorable preconditions. The visual
              paradigm worked flawlessly, as found over several sessions. This
              discrepancy in performance can possibly be explained by the
              user's clinical deficit in several key neuropsychological
              indicators, such as attention and working memory. While the
              auditory paradigm relies on both categories, the visual paradigm
              could be used with lower cognitive workload. Besides attention
              and working memory, several other neurophysiological and
              -psychological indicators - and the role they play in the BCIs at
              hand - are discussed. CONCLUSION: The user's performance on the
              first BCI paradigm would typically have excluded her from further
              ERP-based BCI studies. However, this study clearly shows that,
              with the numerous paradigms now at our disposal, the pursuit for
              a functioning BCI system should not be stopped after an initial
              failed attempt.",

              distinguished based on their spatiotemporal response properties.
              Because nerve fibers reflect local skin deformations, they
              individually carry ambiguous signals about object features. In
              contrast, cortical neurons exhibit heterogeneous response
              properties that reflect computations applied to convergent input
              from multiple classes of afferents, which confer to them a
              selectivity for behaviorally relevant features of objects. The
              conventional view is that these complex response properties arise

  author   = "Long, Katie H and Lieber, Justin D and Bensmaia, Sliman J",
  abstract = "Humans are exquisitely sensitive to the microstructure and
              material properties of surfaces. In the peripheral nerves,
              texture information is conveyed via two mechanisms: coarse
              textural features are encoded in spatial patterns of activation
              that reflect their spatial layout, and fine features are encoded
              in highly repeatable, texture-specific temporal spiking patterns
              evoked as the skin moves across the surface. Here, we examined
              whether this temporal code is preserved in the responses of
              neurons in somatosensory cortex. We scanned a diverse set of
              everyday textures across the fingertip of awake macaques while
              recording the responses evoked in individual cortical neurons. We
              found that temporal spiking patterns are highly repeatable across
              multiple presentations of the same texture, with millisecond
              precision. As a result, texture identity can be reliably decoded
              from the temporal patterns themselves, even after information
              carried in the spike rates is eliminated. However, the
              combination of rate and timing is more informative than either
              code in isolation. The temporal precision of the texture response
              is heterogenous across cortical neurons and depends on the
              submodality composition of their input and on their location
              along the somatosensory neuraxis. Furthermore, temporal spiking
              patterns in cortex dilate and contract with decreases and
              increases in scanning speed, respectively, and this systematic
              relationship between speed and patterning may contribute to the
              observed perceptual invariance to speed. Finally, we find that
              the quality of a texture percept can be better predicted when
              these temporal patterns are taken into consideration. We conclude
              that high-precision spike timing complements rate-based signals

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is assessed via
              cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Positron emission tomography (PET).
              Novel methods to detect phosphorylated tau (pTau) in blood have
              been recently developed. We aim to investigate agreement of tau
              status as determined by [18F]MK6240 tau-PET, plasma pTau181 and
              pTau231. METHODS: We assessed cognitively unimpaired young,
              cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment and AD
              individuals with [18F]MK6240, plasma pTau181, pTau 231,
              [18F]AZD4694 amyloid-PET and MRI. A subset underwent CSF
              assessment. We conducted ROC curves to obtain cut-off values for
              plasma pTau epitopes. Individuals were categorized as positive or
              negative in all biomarkers. We then compared the distribution
              among concordant and discordant groups in relation to diagnosis,
              A$\beta$ status, APOE$\epsilon$4 status, [18F]AZD4694 global
              SUVR, hippocampal volume and CSF pTau181. FINDINGS: The threshold
              for positivity was 15.085 pg/mL for plasma pTau181 and 17.652
              pg/mL for plasma pTau231. Most individuals had concordant
              statuses, however, 18\% of plasma181/PET, 26\% of plasma231/PET
              and 25\% of the pTau231/pTau181 were discordant. Positivity to at
              least one biomarker was often accompanied by diagnosis of
              cognitive impairment, A$\beta$ positivity, APOE$\epsilon$4
              carriership, higher levels of [18F]AZD4694 global SUVR,
              hippocampal atrophy and CSF pTau181. INTERPRETATION: Plasma
              pTau181, pTau231 and [18F]MK6240 seem to reflect different stages
              of tau progression. Plasma biomarkers can be useful in the
              context of diagnostic information and clinical trials, to
              evaluate the disease stage. Moreover, they seem to confidently
              evaluate tau-PET positivity. FUNDING: Moreover, this study was

              a surge in hours of recordings in naturalistic environments,
              allowing further insight into neurological and psychiatric
              disease states. However, high amplitude, high frequency
              stimulation generates artifacts that contaminate neural signals
              and hinder our ability to interpret the data. This is especially
              true in psychiatric disorders, for which high amplitude
              stimulation is commonly applied to deep brain structures where
              the native neural activity is miniscule in comparison. Here, we
              characterized artifact sources in recordings from a bidirectional
              DBS platform, the Medtronic Summit RC + S, with the goal of
              optimizing recording configurations to improve signal to noise
              ratio (SNR). Data were collected from three subjects in a
              clinical trial of DBS for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
              Stimulation was provided bilaterally to the ventral
              capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) using two independent
              implantable neurostimulators. We first manipulated DBS amplitude
              within safe limits (2--5.3 mA) to characterize the impact of
              stimulation artifacts on neural recordings. We found that high
              amplitude stimulation produces slew overflow, defined as
              exceeding the rate of change that the analog to digital converter
              can accurately measure. Overflow led to expanded spectral
              distortion of the stimulation artifact, with a six fold increase
              in the bandwidth of the 150.6 Hz stimulation artifact from
              147--153 to 140--180 Hz. By increasing sense blank values during
              high amplitude stimulation, we reduced overflow by as much as
              30\% and improved artifact distortion, reducing the bandwidth
              from 140--180 Hz artifact to 147--153 Hz. We also identified
              artifacts that shifted in frequency through modulation of
              telemetry parameters. We found that telemetry ratio changes led
              to predictable shifts in the center-frequencies of the associated
              artifacts, allowing us to proactively shift the artifacts outside
              of our frequency range of interest. Overall, the artifact
              characterization methods and results described here enable
              increased data interpretability and unconstrained biomarker

              if field identification of ELVO, reduces door to groin
              time.Background Endovascular treatment of stroke is now the
              standard of care for large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke within 6
              hours of onset. The outcomes of intra-arterial (IA) endovascular
              treatment are time dependent. The time from arrival to groin vary
              during the day time versus after hours or infield transfers
              compared to hospital to hospital transfers. Pre-identification of
              LVO from field can shorten the door to groin time by activation
              of Interventional Radiology (IR) team earlier. We designed a
              scale that can be used by EMS personnel in the field to identify
              ELVO or non-Emergency Large Vessel Occlusion.Methods and analysis
              Ventura ELVO Scale (VES) comprise of four components: 1) Eye
              Deviation 2) Aphasia 3) Neglect 4) Obtundation, each component
              scoring either 1 or 0. The maximum score is 4 and minimum score
              is 0. The score of 1 or greater will be considered as ELVO
              positive. VES will be implemented by EMS to identify ELVO
              patients in the catchment area of Los Robles Hospital and Medical
              Center. Retrospective data will be collected from EMS, Emergency
              Department (ED) and IR records of participating patients. Door to
              groin time for intra-arterial (IA) treatment before
              implementation of the Ventura ELVO protocol will be compared with
              door to groin time after implementation of Ventura ELVO protocol.
              In prospective patients, EMS will measure ELVO score in the field
              using the VES. A positive ELVO score along with positive
              Cincinnati scale will prompt ELVO activation. EMS will call the
              neuro-interventionist who will then activate the
              neuro-intervention protocol at the receiving
              Hospital.Implications Ventura ELVO scale can help to reduce door
              to groin puncture time, which can possibly improve the management

              recordings from the cortices of humans and macaques across normal

              Our evidence suggests that cortical information processing is

              low-frequency cortical electric oscillations away from this

               validity. Researchers have proposed the use of Brain-Machine
               interface (BMI) systems as cognitive training tools but still
               face the limitation that the user cannot move freely while
               performing the cognitive training. Previously, we reported the
               successful use of a BMI system with a physical robotic third arm

               simultaneously, thereby engaging multiple cognitive skills such
               as attention switching, mental focus, coordination, decision
               making and visual information processing. In this paper, we
               present a cognitive training platform based on our previous

               (VR) experience. We conducted an experiment to investigate the

               showed that mean difference in attention accuracy scores were
               3.96 s faster for the BMI-VR group compared to the AST group.

                   miniaturized neural interfaces that will use brain inspired
                   AI techniques with neuromorphic hardware to process the data
                   from the brain. This will be referred to as Brain Inspired
                   Brain Computer Interfaces (BI-BCIs). Such neural interfaces
                   would offer access to deeper brain regions and better
                   understanding for brain's functions and working mechanism,
                   which improves BCIs operative stability and system's
                   efficiency. On one hand, brain inspired AI algorithms
                   represented by spiking neural networks (SNNs) would be used
                   to interpret the multimodal neural signals in the BCI
                   system. On the other hand, due to the ability of SNNs to
                   capture rich dynamics of biological neurons and to represent
                   and integrate different information dimensions such as time,
                   frequency, and phase, it would be used to model and encode
                   complex information processing in the brain and to provide
                   feedback to the users. This paper provides an overview of
                   the different methods to interface with the brain, presents
                   future applications and discusses the merger of AI and BCIs.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Patient stratification is the division of a patient
              population into distinct subgroups based on the presence or
              absence of particular disease characteristics. As patient
              stratification can be used to account for the underlying
              pathology of a disease, it can help physicians to tailor
              therapeutic interventions to individuals and optimize their care
              management and treatment regime. Alzheimer's disease, the most
              common form of dementia, is a heterogeneous disease and its
              management benefits from patient stratification in clinical
              trials, and the development of personalized care and treatment
              strategies for people living with the disease. MAIN BODY: In this
              review, we discuss the importance of the stratification of people
              living with Alzheimer's disease, the challenges associated with
              early diagnosis and patient stratification, and the evolution of
              patient stratification once disease-modifying therapies become
              widely available. CONCLUSION: Patient stratification plays an
              important role in drug development in clinical trials and may
              play an even larger role in clinical practice. A timely diagnosis
              and stratification of people living with Alzheimer's disease is
              paramount in determining people who are at risk of progressing
              from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia. There are
              key issues associated with stratifying patients which include the
              heterogeneity and complex neurobiology behind Alzheimer's
              disease, our inadequately prepared healthcare systems, and the
              cultural perceptions of Alzheimer's disease. Stratifying people
              living with Alzheimer's disease may be the key in establishing
              precision and personalized medicine in the field, optimizing
              disease prevention and pharmaceutical treatment to slow or stop
              cognitive decline, while minimizing adverse effects.",

  abstract = "Recent disputes over the NIH Neuroethics Roadmap have revealed
              underlying tensions between neuroethics and the broader
              neuroscience community. These controversies should spur
              neuroethicists to more clearly articulate an oft-cited ideal of
              ``integrating'' neuroethics in neuroscience. In this, it is
              useful to consider the integration of bioethics in medical
              practice as both historical precedent and context for integration
              in neuroethics. Bioethics began as interdisciplinary scholars
              joined biomedical institutions to serve on newly-created IRBs and
              hospital ethics committees. These early bioethicists identified
              as outsiders and their presence was initially resisted by some in
              the medical establishment, but over time they became integrated
              into the very institutions that many had originally come to
              critique. This work has transformed medical practice, but also
              required compromises and intellectual costs. Also, the successful
              integration of bioethics relied in part on structural features of
              postwar medicine with no clear analogue in contemporary
              neuroscience; for neuroethics, imaginative new approaches will
              also be needed. While neuroethics to date has focused somewhat
              narrowly on questions in neurotechnology, I argue that successful
              integration in neuroethics will likely require a broader vision,
              encompassing the clinical neurosciences as well as questions at
              the interface of neuroscience and society.",

              physiological responses (Skin Conductance Responses, SCRs)
              associated to a threatening stimulus approaching the virtual
              hand. Participants observed in first person perspective a virtual
              body having the right hand-forearm (i) connected by a normal
              wrist (Full-Limb) or a thin rigid wire connection (Wire) or (ii)
              disconnected because of a missing wrist (m-Wrist) or a missing

              of SCRs were found also during observation of the non-natural,
              rigid wire connection condition. This result suggests that the

              of Parkinson's disease (PD). It remains uncertain whether
              declines in specific cognitive domains relate to imaging or
              plasma biomarkers across the disease continuum. OBJECTIVE: We
              investigated whether neuroimaging and plasma biomarkers correlate
              with individual task-specific cognitive domain declines evidenced
              by computerized neuropsychological tests in PD patients. METHODS:
              A total of 107 participants, including 87 PD patients (30 with
              normal cognition [PD-NC], 30 with mild cognitive impairment
              [PD-MCI], 27 with dementia [PDD]), and 20 healthy controls, were
              recruited. All received the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
              Automatic Battery (CANTAB) test, brain MRI, and assays of plasma
              biomarkers, including $\alpha$-synuclein, tau, A$\beta$42, and
              A$\beta$40. RESULTS: PD patients had generally poorer cognitive
              performance than controls. Patients with PD-MCI and PDD had worse
              performance in visual, verbal, and working memory and executive
              function than those with PD-NC. After adjusting for covariates,
              PDD patients had global cortical thinning, especially in the
              temporal and parietal lobes, and higher plasma $\alpha$-synuclein
              levels and tau:A$\beta$42 ratios than PD-NC group. Plasma
              $\alpha$-synuclein level was associated with frontal
              lobe-mediated tasks, while the tau:A$\beta$42 ratio was
              associated with posterior cortical-mediated tasks. Facial emotion
              recognition tasks and visual pattern recognition associated with
              frontotemporal cortical thinning. The accuracy of predicting PDD
              using age alone (area under the curve [AUC] 0.756) increased by
              incorporating plasma biomarkers (AUC = 0.851, p = 0.025).
              CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline in PD patients has a task-specific
              correlation with neuroimaging and plasma biomarkers, which may
              implicate the underlying neuropathological process of PDD.",

  abstract = "In resting tremor, the body part is in complete repose and often
              dampens or subsides entirely with action. The most frequent cause
              of resting tremors is known as idiopathic Parkinson's disease
              (PD). For examination, neurologists of patients with PD include
              tests such as finger-to-nose tests, walking back and forth in the
              corridor, and the pull test. This evaluation is focused on
              Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), which is
              subjective as well as based on some daily life motor activities
              for a limited time frame. In this study, severity analysis is
              performed on an imbalanced dataset of patients with PD. This is
              the reason why the classification of various data containing
              imbalanced class distribution has endured a notable drawback of
              the performance achievable by various standard classification
              learning algorithms. In this work, we used resampling techniques
              including under-sampling, over-sampling, and a hybrid

              classifiers, such as XGBoost, decision tree, and K-nearest
              neighbors. From the results, it is concluded that the
              Over-sampling method performed much better than under-sampling
              and hybrid sampling techniques. Among the over-sampling
              techniques, random sampling has obtained 99\% accuracy using
              XGBoost classifier and 98\% accuracy using the decision tree.

              Scan. Also, different machine learning methods are utilized for
              automatic diagnosis but existing has some limitations in terms of

              preprocessing method before CNN model to increase the accuracy of
              classification. Materials and method In this paper, we present a
              deep learning-based approach for detection of Alzheimer's Disease
              from ADNI database of Alzheimer's disease patients, the dataset
              contains fMRI and PET images of Alzheimer's patients along with
              normal person's image. We have applied 3D to 2D conversion and
              resizing of images before applying VGG-16 architecture of
              Convolution neural network for feature extraction. Finally, for
              classification SVM, Linear Discriminate, K means clustering, and
              Decision tree classifiers are used. Results The experimental
              result shows that the average accuracy of 99.95\% is achieved for
              the classification of the fMRI dataset, while the average
              accuracy of 73.46\% is achieved with the PET dataset. On
              comparing results on the basis of accuracy, specificity,
              sensitivity and on some other parameters we found that these

              cognitive normal (CN) has become popular. Neuroimaging and
              computer-aided diagnosis techniques are used for classification
              of AD by physicians in the early stage. Most of the previous
              machine learning techniques work on handpicked features. In the
              recent days, deep learning has been applied for many medical
              image applications. Existing deep learning systems work on raw

              an input to the convolution neural network (CNN) to perform
              classification of AD. AD affects the brain volume and changes the
              gray matter texture. In our work, we used 1820 T2-weighted brain
              magnetic resonance volumes including 635 AD MRIs, 548 MCI MRIs,
              and 637 CN MRIs, sliced into 18,017 voxels. We proposed an
              approach to extract the gray matter from brain voxels and perform
              the classification using the CNN. A Gaussian filter is used to
              enhance the voxels, and skull stripping algorithm is used to
              remove the irrelevant tissues from enhanced voxels. Then, those
              voxels are segmented by hybrid enhanced independent component
              analysis. Segmented gray matter is used as an input to the CNN.

  abstract = "Author(s): Low, Philip Steven | Abstract: Despite over 70 years
              of active research in mammalian EEGs, most of the neural
              structures responsible for sleep and waking rhythms have yet to
              be identified. At time of writing, three major beliefs pervade
              the field of sleep : 1) The neocortex is largely necessary for
              the production of ``mammalian'' sleep rhythms; 2) Human REM sleep
              is ``paradoxical'' insofar as the oscillations produced during
              REM sleep are ``awake-like''; 3) Human sleep can only be
              objectively analyzed by human scorer. This way of looking at
              sleep is in need of major revision, as : 1) Birds, devoid of a
              neocortex, can produce oscillations which bare great similarity
              with those observed in mammals, in terms of both their raw
              signals and ultradian properties; 2) A temporal map of brain
              activity produced using a single channel of EEG is sufficient to
              clearly show that REM sleep and Waking have different and
              separable EEG profiles. Human REM sleep is therefore not
              paradoxical. 3) Sleep and Waking Stages can in fact be easily
              identified computationally using a single channel of EEG,
              obviating the need for human based sleep scoring. Moreover, it
              appears that low-passing from the skull reflected in EEGs can be
              easily circumvented, thus providing researchers and clinicians
              with a non-invasive window into brain activity, with high
              resolution in both the time and frequency domains. Furthermore,
              the possibility of there being yet another human sleep state
              should be fully explored. The use of these and similar techniques
              will hopefully minimize the significant strain placed on both
              humans and animals in at least the contexts of medicine as well
              as basic and clinical research",

              the glutamatergic system might thus provide a novel molecular
              strategy for antidepressant treatment. Since glutamate is the
              most abundant and major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain,

              to affect neurobehavioral plasticity, information processing and
              large-scale changes in functional brain connectivity underlying
              certain symptoms of major depressive disorder. Using resting
              state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), the
              ``dorsal nexus ''(DN) was recently identified as a bilateral
              dorsal medial prefrontal cortex region showing dramatically
              increased depression-associated functional connectivity with
              large portions of a cognitive control network (CCN), the default
              mode network (DMN), and a rostral affective network (AN). Hence,
              Sheline and colleagues (2010) proposed that reducing increased
              connectivity of the DN might play a critical role in reducing
              depression symptomatology and thus represent a potential therapy
              target for affective disorders. Here, using a randomized,
              placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover rsfMRI challenge in
              healthy subjects we demonstrate that ketamine decreases
              functional connectivity of the DMN to the DN and to the pregenual
              anterior cingulate (PACC) and medioprefrontal cortex (MPFC) via
              its representative hub, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).

              elucidate potential biomechanisms that are addressed by
              successful treatment of major depression. This notion is further
              supported by the temporal overlap of our observation of subacute
              functional network modulation after 24 hours with the peak of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions have proven efficacy
              in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the
              neurobiological mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects is
              unknown. As mindfulness meditation cultivates attention to the
              present moment and bodily sensations, neural functions related to
              interoception (i.e., central processes of bodily signals) might
              be such a mechanism. METHODS: We conducted a clinical trial in
              which veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive an
              8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention (n
              = 47) or an active control intervention (present-centered group
              therapy; n = 51). We assessed pre- and postintervention PTSD
              symptoms and electroencephalography measures of neural outcomes,
              including spontaneous brain activity, cognitive task-related
              brain responses, and interoceptive brain responses
              (heartbeat-evoked brain responses). We conducted statistical
              causal mediation analyses using treatment type as a predictor,
              pre- and postintervention measures of symptom severity as
              treatment response, and the neural outcomes as mediators.
              RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the MBSR group had
              greater improvements in PTSD symptoms and increases in
              spontaneous alpha power (8-13 Hz), task-related frontal theta
              power (4-7 Hz in 140-220 ms after stimulus), and frontal theta
              heartbeat-evoked brain responses (3-5 Hz and 265-336 ms after R
              peak). The mediation analysis using latent difference score
              modeling revealed that only changes in frontal theta
              heartbeat-evoked brain responses mediated the MBSR treatment
              effect. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness meditation improves brain
              functions of attentional control and resting brain states
              reflective of internally oriented relaxation. However,
              interoceptive neural functions enhanced by MBSR seem to be a
              primary cerebral mechanism that improves symptoms of PTSD.",

              procedure for patients with Parkinson's disease with motor
              fluctuations, dyskinesia, or tremor. Routine follow-up of
              patients allows clinicians to anticipate replacement of the DBS
              battery reaching the end of its life. Patients who experience a
              sudden stop of the DBS battery experience a rapid worsening of
              symptoms unresponsive to high dose of levodopa, in a
              life-threatening phenomenon called ``DBS-withdrawal syndrome.''
              In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which many
              surgeries are being deprogrammed, it is of utmost importance to
              determine to what extent DBS battery replacement surgeries should
              be considered an emergency. In this study, we attempt to identify
              risk factors of DBS-withdrawal syndrome and provide new insights
              about pathophysiological hypotheses. We then elaborate on the
              optimal approach to avoid and manage such a situation. Materials
              and Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature on
              the subject and reported the cases of 20 patients (including five
              from our experience) with DBS-withdrawal syndrome, comparing them
              with 15 undisturbed patients (including three from our
              experience), all having undergone neurostimulation
              discontinuation. Results A long disease duration at battery
              removal and many years of DBS therapy are the main potential
              identified risk factors (p < 0.005). In addition, a trend for
              older age at the event and higher Unified Parkinson's Disease
              Rating Scale motor score before initial DBS implantation
              (evaluated in OFF-drug condition) was found (p < 0.05). We
              discuss several hypotheses that might explain this phenomenon,
              including discontinued functioning of the thalamic-basal ganglia
              loop due to DBS-stimulation cessation in a context in which
              cortical-basal ganglia loop had lost its cortical input, and
              possible onset of a severe bradykinesia through the simultaneous
              occurrence of an alpha and high-beta synchronized state.
              Conclusions The patients' clinical condition may deteriorate
              rapidly, be unresponsive to high dose of levodopa, and become
              life-threatening. Hospitalization is suggested for clinical
              monitoring. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it
              is important to widely communicate the replacement of DBS
              batteries reaching the end of their life. More importantly, in
              cases in which the battery has stopped, there should be no delay
              in performing replacement as an emergent surgery.",

              participants while performing multisensory spatial and temporal
              bisection tasks. Audiovisual stimuli occurred at three different
              spatial positions and time lags and participants had to evaluate
              whether the second stimulus was spatially (spatial bisection
              task) or temporally (temporal bisection task) farther from the
              first or third audiovisual stimulus. As predicted, the second
              audiovisual stimulus of both spatial and temporal bisection tasks
              elicited an early ERP response (time window 50-90 ms) in visual
              and auditory regions. However, this early ERP component was more
              substantial in the occipital areas during the spatial bisection
              task, and in the temporal regions during the temporal bisection
              task. Overall, these results confirmed the domain specificity of
              visual and auditory cortices and revealed that this aspect
              selectively modulates also the cortical activity in response to
              multisensory stimuli.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia show deficits in
              early-stage visual processing, potentially reflecting dysfunction
              of the magnocellular visual pathway. The magnocellular system
              operates normally in a nonlinear amplification mode mediated by
              glutamatergic (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. Investigating
              magnocellular dysfunction in schizophrenia therefore permits
              evaluation of underlying etiologic hypotheses. OBJECTIVES: To
              evaluate magnocellular dysfunction in schizophrenia, relative to
              known neurochemical and neuroanatomical substrates, and to
              examine relationships between electrophysiological and behavioral
              measures of visual pathway dysfunction and relationships with
              higher cognitive deficits. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
              Between-group study at an inpatient state psychiatric hospital
              and outpatient county psychiatric facilities. Thirty-three
              patients met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective
              disorder, and 21 nonpsychiatric volunteers of similar ages
              composed the control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1)
              Magnocellular and parvocellular evoked potentials, analyzed using
              nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) and linear contrast gain approaches;
              (2) behavioral contrast sensitivity measures; (3) white matter
              integrity; (4) visual and nonvisual neuropsychological measures,
              and (5) clinical symptom and community functioning measures.
              RESULTS: Patients generated evoked potentials that were
              significantly reduced in response to magnocellular-biased, but
              not parvocellular-biased, stimuli (P = .001). Michaelis-Menten
              analyses demonstrated reduced contrast gain of the magnocellular
              system (P = .001). Patients showed decreased contrast sensitivity
              to magnocellular-biased stimuli (P<.001). Evoked potential
              deficits were significantly related to decreased white matter
              integrity in the optic radiations (P<.03). Evoked potential
              deficits predicted impaired contrast sensitivity (P = .002),
              which was in turn related to deficits in complex visual
              processing (P< or =.04). Both evoked potential (P< or =.04) and
              contrast sensitivity (P = .01) measures significantly predicted
              community functioning. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the
              existence of early-stage visual processing dysfunction in
              schizophrenia and provide the first evidence that such deficits
              are due to decreased nonlinear signal amplification, consistent
              with glutamatergic theories. Neuroimaging studies support the
              hypothesis of dysfunction within low-level visual pathways
              involving thalamocortical radiations. Deficits in early-stage
              visual processing significantly predict higher cognitive
              deficits.",

  author   = "Rohde, Marieke and Di Luca, Massimiliano and Ernst, Marc O",
  abstract = "In the Rubber Hand Illusion, the feeling of ownership of a rubber
              hand displaced from a participant's real occluded hand is evoked
              by synchronously stroking both hands with paintbrushes. A change
              of perceived finger location towards the rubber hand
              (proprioceptive drift) has been reported to correlate with this
              illusion. To measure the time course of proprioceptive drift
              during the Rubber Hand Illusion, we regularly interrupted
              stroking (performed by robot arms) to measure perceived finger
              location. Measurements were made by projecting a probe dot into
              the field of view (using a semi-transparent mirror) and asking
              participants if the dot is to the left or to the right of their
              invisible hand (Experiment 1) or to adjust the position of the
              dot to that of their invisible hand (Experiment 2). We varied
              both the measurement frequency (every 10 s, 40 s, 120 s) and the
              mode of stroking (synchronous, asynchronous, just vision).
              Surprisingly, with frequent measurements, proprioceptive drift
              occurs not only in the synchronous stroking condition but also in
              the two control conditions (asynchronous stroking, just vision).
              Proprioceptive drift in the synchronous stroking condition is
              never higher than in the just vision condition. Only continuous
              exposure to asynchronous stroking prevents proprioceptive drift
              and thus replicates the differences in drift reported in the
              literature. By contrast, complementary subjective ratings
              (questionnaire) show that the feeling of ownership requires
              synchronous stroking and is not present in the asynchronous
              stroking condition. Thus, subjective ratings and drift are
              dissociated. We conclude that different mechanisms of
              multisensory integration are responsible for proprioceptive drift
              and the feeling of ownership. Proprioceptive drift relies on
              visuoproprioceptive integration alone, a process that is
              inhibited by asynchronous stroking, the most common control
              condition in Rubber Hand Illusion experiments. This dissociation
              implies that conclusions about feelings of ownership cannot be
              drawn from measuring proprioceptive drift alone.",

  abstract = "Clinical outcomes vary among youths at clinical high risk for
              psychosis (CHR-P), with approximately 20\% progressing to
              full-blown psychosis over 2 to 3 years and 30\% achieving
              remission. Recent research efforts have focused on identifying
              biomarkers that precede psychosis onset and enhance the accuracy
              of clinical outcome prediction in CHR-P individuals, with the
              ultimate goal of developing staged treatment approaches based on
              the individual's level of risk. Identifying such biomarkers may
              also facilitate progress toward understanding pathogenic
              mechanisms underlying psychosis onset, which may support the
              development of mechanistically informed early interventions for
              psychosis. In recent years, electroencephalography-based
              event-related potential measures with established sensitivity to
              schizophrenia have gained traction in the study of CHR-P and its
              clinical outcomes. In this review, we describe the evidence for
              event-related potential abnormalities in CHR-P and discuss how
              they inform our understanding of information processing deficits
              as vulnerability markers for emerging psychosis and as indicators
              of future outcomes. Among the measures studied, P300 and mismatch
              negativity are notable because deficits predict conversion to
              psychosis and/or CHR-P remission. However, the accuracy with
              which these and other measures predict outcomes in CHR-P has been
              obscured in the prior literature by the tendency to only report
              group-level differences, underscoring the need for inclusion of
              individual predictive accuracy metrics in future studies.
              Nevertheless, both P300 and mismatch negativity show promise as
              electrophysiological markers of risk for psychosis, as target
              engagement measures for clinical trials, and as potential
              translational bridges between human studies and animal models

  abstract = "Electroencephalography-neurofeedback (EEG-NF) has become a
              valuable tool in the field of psychology, e.g., to improve
              cognitive function. Nevertheless, a large percentage of NF users
              seem to be unable to control their own brain activation.
              Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether a
              different kind of visual feedback could positively influence NF
              performance after one training session. Virtual reality (VR)
              seems to have beneficial training effects and has already been
              reported to increase motivational training aspects. In the
              present study, we tested 61 young healthy adults (mean age: 23.48
              years; 28 female) to investigate, whether 3D VR-based NF training
              has a more beneficial effect on the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR,
              12-15 Hz) power increase than a mere 2D conventional NF paradigm.
              In the 3D group, participants had to roll a ball along a
              predefined path in an immersive virtual environment, whereas the
              2D group had to increase the height of a bar. Both paradigms were
              presented using VR goggles. Participants completed one baseline
              and six feedback runs with 3 min each, in which they should try
              to increase SMR power over Cz. Half of the participants received
              real feedback whereas the other half received sham feedback.
              Participants receiving 3D VR-based feedback showed a linear
              increase in SMR power over the feedback runs within one training
              session. This was the case for the real as well as for the sham
              3D feedback group and might be related to more general VR-related
              effects. The 2D group receiving the conventional bar feedback
              showed no changes in SMR power over the feedback runs. The
              present study underlines that the visual feedback modality has
              differential effects on the NF training performance and that 3D
              VR-based feedback has advantages over conventional 2D feedback.",

              averaging data from populations of subjects with Alzheimer's

              driven by age-related damage to macromolecules and organelles
              which results in the following series of dynamic processes. (1)
              Metabolic alteration: Upregulation of OxPhos activity by
              dysfunctional neurons. (2) Natural selection: Competition for the
              limited energy substrates between neurons with normal OxPhos
              activity [Type (1)] and dysfunctional neurons with increased
              OxPhos [Type (2)]. (3) Propagation, due to the fact that Type (1)

              Parkinson's disease (PD) using subthalamic (STN) neural feedback
              has been shown to be efficacious only in the acute post-operative
              setting, using externalized leads and stimulators. OBJECTIVE: To
              determine feasibility of neural (N)clDBS using the clinical
              implanted neurostimulator (Activa™ PC + S, FDA IDE approved) and
              a novel beta dual threshold algorithm in tremor and bradykinesia
              dominant PD patients on chronic DBS. METHODS: 13 PD subjects (20
              STNs), on open loop (ol)DBS for 22 $\pm$ 7.8 months, consented to
              NclDBS driven by beta (13-30 Hz) power using a dual threshold
              algorithm, based on patient specific therapeutic voltage windows.
              Tremor was assessed continuously, and bradykinesia was evaluated
              after 20 min of NclDBS using a repetitive wrist flexion-extension
              task (rWFE). Total electrical energy delivered (TEED) on NclDBS
              was compared to olDBS using the same active electrode. RESULTS:
              NclDBS was tolerated for 21.67 [21.10-26.15] minutes; no subject
              stopped early. Resting beta band power was measurable and similar
              between tremor and bradykinesia dominant patients. NclDBS
              improved bradykinesia and tremor while delivering only 56.86\% of
              the TEED of olDBS; rWFE velocity (p = 0.003) and frequency (p <
              0.001) increased; tremor was below 0.15 rad/sec for 95.4\% of the
              trial and averaged 0.26 rad/sec when present. CONCLUSION: This is
              the first study to demonstrate that STN NclDBS is feasible,
              efficacious and more efficient than olDBS in tremor and

              (GPi) in patients with Parkinson's disease utilizing directional
              (segmented) deep brain stimulation (dDBS) leads. Data were
              collected from externalized dDBS leads of three patients with
              idiopathic Parkinson's disease after overnight withdrawal of
              parkinsonian medication at rest and during a cued reach-to-target
              task. Oscillatory activity across lead contacts/segments was
              examined in the context of lead locations and contact
              orientations determined using co-registered preoperative 7 Tesla
              (T) MRI and postoperative CT scans. Each of the three patients
              displayed a unique frequency spectrum of oscillatory activity in
              the pallidum, with prominent peaks ranging from 5 to 35 Hz, that
              modulated variably across subjects during volitional movement.
              Despite subject-specific spectral profiles, a consistent finding
              across patients was that oscillatory power was strongest and had
              the largest magnitude of modulation during movement in LFPs
              recorded from segments facing the postero-lateral
              ``sensorimotor'' region of GPi, whereas antero-medially-directed
              segmented contacts facing the internal capsule and/or anterior
              GPi, had relatively weaker LFP power and less modulation in the 5
              to 35 Hz. In each subject, contact configurations chosen for
              clinically therapeutic stimulation (following data collection and
              blinded to physiology recordings), were in concordance with the
              contact pairs showing the largest amplitude of LFP oscillations
              in the 5-35 Hz range. Although limited to three subjects, these
              findings provide support for the hypothesis that the sensorimotor
              territory of the GPi corresponds to the site of maximal power of
              oscillatory activity in the 5 to 35 Hz and provides the greatest
              benefit in motor signs during stimulation in the GPi. Variability
              in oscillatory activity across patients is likely related to
              Parkinson's disease phenotype as well as small differences in
              recording location (i.e. lead location), highlighting the
              importance of lead location for optimizing stimulation efficacy.
              These data also provide compelling evidence for the use of LFP

              potentials recorded from directional contacts as a predictor of
              the most efficient contacts for stimulation in patients with PD.
              METHODS: Intraoperative local field potentials were recorded from
              directional contacts in the STN of 12 patients and beta activity
              compared with the results of the clinical contact review
              performed after 4 to 7 months. RESULTS: Normalized beta activity
              was positively correlated with the contact's clinical efficacy.
              The two contacts with the highest beta activity included the most
              efficient stimulation contact in up to 92\% and that with the

  abstract = "Background: The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy
              in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is highly dependent on the
              precise localization of the target structures such as subthalamic
              nucleus (STN). Most commonly, microelectrode single unit activity
              (SUA) recordings are performed to refine the target. This process
              is heavily experience based and can be technically challenging.
              Local field potentials (LFPs), representing the activity of a
              population of neurons, can be obtained from the same
              microelectrodes used for SUA recordings and allow flexible online
              processing with less computational complexity due to lower
              sampling rate requirements. Although LFPs have been shown to
              contain biomarkers capable of predicting patients' symptoms and
              differentiating various structures, their use in the localization
              of the STN in the clinical practice is not prevalent. Methods:
              Here we present, for the first time, a randomized and
              double-blinded pilot study with intraoperative online LFP
              processing in which we compare the clinical benefit from SUA-
              versus LFP-based implantation. Ten PD patients referred for
              bilateral STN-DBS were randomly implanted using either SUA or LFP
              guided targeting in each hemisphere. Although both SUA and LFP
              were recorded for each STN, the electrophysiologist was blinded
              to one at a time. Three months postoperatively, the patients were
              evaluated by a neurologist blinded to the intraoperative
              recordings to assess the performance of each modality. While
              SUA-based decisions relied on the visual and auditory inspection
              of the raw traces, LFP-based decisions were given through an
              online signal processing and machine learning pipeline. Results:
              We found a dramatic agreement between LFP- and SUA-based
              localization (16/20 STNs) providing adequate clinical improvement
              (51.8\% decrease in 3-month contralateral motor assessment
              scores), with LFP-guided implantation resulting in greater
              average improvement in the discordant cases (74.9\%, n = 3 STNs).
              The selected tracks were characterized by higher activity in beta
              (11-32 Hz) and high-frequency (200-400 Hz) bands (p < 0.01) of
              LFPs and stronger non-linear coupling between these bands (p <
              0.05). Conclusion: Our pilot study shows equal or better clinical
              benefit with LFP-based targeting. Given the robustness of the
              electrode interface and lower computational cost, more centers
              can utilize LFP as a strategic feedback modality
              intraoperatively, in conjunction to the SUA-guided targeting.",

              since become a popular platform for DBS imaging. With support of
              a broad community of researchers worldwide, methods have been

              into standard space. Results show that this approach
              significantly improved coregistration accuracy over previously
              published methods. Finally, a sub-segmentation of STN and GPi
              into functional zones was achieved based on structural
              connectivity. The result is a composite atlas that defines key
              nuclei on the template itself, fills the gaps between them using
              histology and further subdivides them using structural
              connectivity. We show that the atlas can be used to segment DBS
              targets in single subjects, yielding more accurate results
              compared to priorly published atlases. The atlas will be made
              publicly available and constitutes a resource to study DBS
              electrode localizations in combination with modern neuroimaging
              methods.",

  abstract = "Previous research suggests integration of visual and
              somatosensory inputs is enhanced within reaching (peripersonal)
              space. In such experiments, somatosensory inputs are presented on
              the body while visual inputs are moved relatively closer to, or
              further from the body. It is unclear, therefore, whether enhanced
              integration in ``peripersonal space'' is truly due to proximity
              of visual inputs to the body space, or, simply the distance
              between the inputs (which also affects integration). Using a
              modified induction of the rubber hand illusion, here we measured
              proprioceptive drift as an index of visuosomatosensory
              integration when distance between the two inputs was constrained,
              and absolute distance from the body was varied. Further, we
              investigated whether integration varies with proximity of inputs
              to the habitual action space of the arm-rather than the actual
              arm itself. In Experiment 1, integration was enhanced with inputs
              proximal to habitual action space, and reduced with lateral
              distance from this space. This was not attributable to an
              attentional or perceptual bias of external space because the
              pattern of proprioceptive drift was opposite for left and right
              hand illusions, that is, consistently maximal at the shoulder of
              origin (Experiment 2). We conclude that habitual patterns of
              action modulate visuosomatosensory integration. It appears
              multisensory integration is modulated in locations of space that
              are functionally relevant for behavior, whether an actual body
              part resides within that space or not. (PsycINFO Database Record",

              degeneration (FTLD) are the two most common forms of
              neurodegenerative dementia. Although both of them have
              well-established diagnostic criteria, achieving early diagnosis
              remains challenging. Here, we aimed to make the differential
              diagnosis of AD and FTLD from clinical, neuropsychological, and
              neuroimaging features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this
              retrospective study, we selected 95 patients with PET-CT defined
              AD and 106 patients with PET-CT/biomarker-defined FTLD. We
              performed structured chart examination to collect clinical data
              and ascertain clinical features. A series of neuropsychological
              scales were used to assess the neuropsychological characteristics
              of patients. Automatic tissue segmentation of brain by Dr. Brain
              tool was used to collect multi-parameter volumetric measurements
              from different brain areas. All patients' structural neuroimage
              data were analyzed to obtain brain structure and white matter
              hyperintensities (WMH) quantitative data. RESULTS: The prevalence
              of vascular disease associated factors was higher in AD patients
              than that in FTLD group. 56.84\% of patients with AD carried at
              least one APOE $\epsilon$4 allele, which is much high than that
              in FTLD patients. The first symptoms of AD patients were mostly
              cognitive impairment rather than behavioral abnormalities. In
              contrast, behavioral abnormalities were the prominent early
              manifestations of FTLD, and few patients may be accompanied by
              memory impairment and motor symptoms. In direct comparison,
              patients with AD had slightly more posterior lesions and less
              frontal atrophy, whereas patients with FTLD had more
              frontotemporal atrophy and less posterior lesions. The WMH burden
              of AD was significantly higher, especially in cortical areas,
              while the WMH burden of FTLD was higher in periventricular areas.
              CONCLUSION: These results indicate that dynamic evaluation of
              cognitive function, behavioral and psychological symptoms, and
              multimodal neuroimaging are helpful for the early diagnosis and
              differentiation between AD and FTLD.",

              likely developments in the next two decades. Firstly, we survey
              the main neuroscience technologies for both observing and
              influencing brain activity, which are necessary ingredients for
              human cognitive augmentation. We also compare and contrast such
              technologies, as their individual characteristics (e.g.,
              spatio-temporal resolution, invasiveness, portability, energy
              requirements, and cost) influence their current and future role
              in human cognitive augmentation. Secondly, we chart the state of
              the art on neurotechnologies for human cognitive augmentation,
              keeping an eye both on the applications that already exist and
              those that are emerging or are likely to emerge in the next two
              decades. Particularly, we consider applications in the areas of
              communication, cognitive enhancement, memory, attention
              monitoring/enhancement, situation awareness and complex problem
              solving, and we look at what fraction of the population might
              benefit from such technologies and at the demands they impose in
              terms of user training. Thirdly, we briefly review the ethical
              issues associated with current neuroscience technologies. These

              alterations to conceptions of self and society, and for
              prescriptively judging the ethical applications of

              neuroethics for international relevance requires a new
              meta-ethics: understanding how morality works, and how humans
              manage and improve morality, as objectively based on the brain

              equip neuroethics for evaluating and revising older cultural

              scientifically valid views of encultured humans intelligently

              essentialisms, and unrealistic ethical philosophies, neuroethics

              both physical and mental health care, yet research has
              predominantly focused on barriers to mental health care. This
              study explored a comprehensive set of barriers using hypothetical
              scenarios to quantify barrier impact on access to both mental and
              physical health care. METHODS: Canadian military health services
              personnel (N = 1033) completed one of two electronic surveys
              (assessing either physical health or other mental health
              barriers) that captured participant's demographics, health,
              endorsement of barriers, intent to seek care, and whether the
              respondent would access care in different health scenarios
              (pneumonia, back injury, depression and post-traumatic stress
              disorder). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds of not
              accessing care (versus accessing care) for each of the four
              health scenarios. RESULTS: All barrier factors independently
              predicted increased odds of not accessing care for all four
              scenarios. When entered into an adjusted model none of the
              barrier factors significantly predicted accessing care in the
              physical health scenarios. Staffing and workload resources and
              Treatment preferences (e.g., self-treat) were significant
              predictors of accessing care in the mental health scenarios. Weak
              general intentions to access care was the strongest predictors of
              not accessing care across all four scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: The
              impact of barriers on hypothetical care-seeking behaviour differs
              depending on the context for which one is accessing care, with
              access to resources and preference to self-treat driving mental
              health care seeking. Intent appears to be the most impactful
              predictor of accessing care potentially mediating the effect of
              other barrier types on care seeking.",

               promising cognitive training tools in neurodevelopmental
               disorders, as they combine the advantages of traditional
               computerized interventions with real-time tailored feedback. We
               propose a gamified BCI based on non-volitional neurofeedback for
               cognitive training, aiming at reaching a neurorehabilitation
               tool for application in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).
               Approach: The BCI consists of an emotional facial expression
               paradigm (EFP) controlled by an intelligent agent that makes
               correct and wrong actions, while the user observes and judges
               the agent's actions. The agent learns through reinforcement
               learning (RL) an optimal strategy if the participant generates
               error-related potentials (ErrPs) upon incorrect agent actions.
               We hypothesize that this training approach will allow not only
               the agent to learn but also the BCI user, by participating
               through implicit error scrutiny in the process of learning
               through operant conditioning, making it of particular interest
               for disorders where error monitoring processes are
               altered/compromised such as in ASD. In this paper, the main goal
               is to validate the whole methodological BCI approach and assess
               whether it is feasible enough to move on to clinical
               experiments. A control group of 10 neurotypical participants and
               one participant with ASD tested the proposed BCI approach. Main
               Results: We achieved an online balanced-accuracy in ErrPs
               detection of 81.6\% and 77.1\%, respectively for 2 different
               game modes. Additionally, all participants achieved an optimal
               RL strategy for the agent at least in one of the test sessions.
               Significance: The ErrP classification results and the
               possibility of successfully achieving an optimal learning
               strategy, show the feasibility of the proposed methodology,
               which allows to move towards clinical experimentation with ASD

  abstract = "Background Long-term levodopa use is frequently associated with
              fluctuations in motor response and can have a serious adverse
              effect on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with Parkinson's
              disease (PD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in
              improving symptoms of diminished levodopa responsiveness. QoL
              improvements with DBS have been shown in several randomized
              control trials, mostly in Europe and the United States; however,
              there is a need for evidence from regions around the world.
              Objective The study aimed to demonstrate improvement in
              PD-related QoL in patients undergoing DBS in a prospective,
              multicenter study conducted in China. Materials and Methods To
              evaluate the effect of neurostimulation on the QoL of patients
              with PD, a Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8); Unified
              Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) I, II, III, and IV; and
              EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) were administered at
              baseline and 12 months after DBS implantation. The mean change
              and percent change from baseline were reported for these clinical
              outcomes. Results Assessments were completed for 85 of the 89
              implanted patients. DBS substantially improved patients' QoL and
              function. Implanted patients showed statistically significant
              mean improvement in PDQ-8 and UPDRS III (on stimulation/off
              medication). In the patients who completed the 12-month follow-up
              visit, the percent change was −22.2\% for PDQ-8 and −51.6\% for
              UPDRS III (on stimulation/off medication). Percent change from
              baseline to 12 months for UPDRS I, II, III, and IV and EQ-5D were
              −16.8\%, −39.4\%, −18.5\%, and −50.0\% and 22.7\%, respectively.
              The overall rate of incidence for adverse events was low at
              15.7\%. Favorable outcomes were also reported based on patient
              opinion; 95.3\% were satisfied with DBS results. Conclusions
              These data were comparable to other studies around the world and
              showed alignment with the ability of DBS to meaningfully improve
              the QoL of patients with PD. More studies investigating DBS
              therapy for patients with PD are necessary to accurately
              characterize clinical outcomes for the global PD population.

              memory is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience, and of
              vast importance for a variety of neuropsychiatric,
              neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. Despite a
              recent surge of successful attempts at improving performance in a
              range of memory tasks, the optimal approaches and parameters for
              memory enhancement have yet to be determined. On a more
              fundamental level, it remains elusive how delivering electrical
              current in a given brain area leads to enhanced memory
              processing. Starting from the local and distal physiological
              effects on neural populations, the mechanisms of enhanced memory
              encoding, maintenance, consolidation, or recall in response to
              direct electrical stimulation are only now being unraveled. With
              the advent of innovative neurotechnologies for concurrent
              recording and stimulation intracranially in the human brain, it
              becomes possible to study both acute and chronic effects of
              stimulation on memory performance and the underlying neural
              activities. In this review, we summarize the effects of various
              invasive stimulation approaches for modulating memory functions.
              We first outline the challenges that were faced in the initial
              studies of memory enhancement and the lessons learned.
              Electrophysiological biomarkers are then reviewed as more
              objective measures of the stimulation effects than behavioral
              outcomes. Finally, we classify the various stimulation approaches
              into continuous and phasic modulation with open or closed loop
              for responsive stimulation based on analysis of the recorded
              neural activities. Although the potential advantage of
              closed-loop responsive stimulation over the classic open-loop
              approaches is inconclusive, we foresee the emerging results from
              ongoing longitudinal studies and clinical trials to shed light on
              both the mechanisms and optimal strategies for improving
              declarative memory. Adaptive stimulation based on the biomarker
              analysis over extended periods of time is proposed as a future
              direction for obtaining lasting effects on memory functions.
              Chronic tracking and modulation of neural activities
              intracranially through adaptive stimulation opens tantalizing new
              avenues to continually monitor and treat memory and cognitive
              deficits in a range of brain disorders. Brain co-processors
              created with machine-learning tools and wireless bi-directional

              We suggest increased manual dexterity of the dominant hand causes
              greater representational stability and thus an increased
              resistance to bias by the illusion induction. Second, drift was
              generally greatest when the hand was in its habitual action space
              (i.e., near the shoulder of origin), compared to when it
              laterally displaced towards, or across the midline. This linear
              effect, however, was only significant for the dominant hand-in
              both left- and right-handed groups. Thus, our results reveal
              patterns of habitual hand action modulate drift both within a
              hand (drift varies with proximity to action space), and between
              hands (differences in drift between the dominant and non-dominant
              hands). In contrast, we were unable to find conclusive evidence
              to support, or contradict, an overall difference between left-
              and right-handers in susceptibility to RHI drift (i.e., total
              drift, collapsed across hand positions). In sum, our results
              provide evidence that patterns of daily activity-and the
              subsequent patterns of sensory input-shape multisensory
              integration across space.",

              own body, which makes bodily sensations seem unique to oneself.
              We studied the neural correlates of body ownership by controlling
              whether an external object was accepted as part of the body or
              not. In the rubber hand illusion (RHI), correlated visuotactile
              stimulation causes a fake hand to be perceived as part of one's
              own body. In the present study, we distinguished between the
              causes (i.e., multisensory stimulation) and the effect (i.e., the
              feeling of ownership) of the RHI. Participants watched a right or
              a left rubber hand being touched either synchronously or
              asynchronously with respect to their own unseen right hand. A
              quantifiable correlate of the RHI is a shift in the perceived
              position of the subject's hand toward the rubber hand. We used
              positron emission tomography to identify brain areas whose
              activity correlated with this proprioceptive measure of body
              ownership. Body ownership was related to activity in the right
              posterior insula and the right frontal operculum. Conversely,
              when the rubber hand was not attributed to the self, activity was
              observed in the contralateral parietal cortex, particularly the

  abstract = "When subjects view stimulation of a rubber hand while feeling
              congruent stimulation of their own hand, they may come to feel
              that the rubber hand is part of their own body. This illusion of
              body ownership is termed 'Rubber Hand Illusion' (RHI). We
              investigated sensitivity of RHI to spatial mismatches between
              visual and somatic experience. We compared the effects of spatial
              mismatch between the stimulation of the two hands, and equivalent
              mismatches between the postures of the two hands. We created the
              mismatch either by adjusting stimulation or posture of the
              subject's hand, or, in a separate group of subjects, by adjusting
              stimulation or posture of the rubber hand. The matching processes
              underlying body ownership were asymmetrical. The illusion
              survived small changes in the subject's hand posture, but
              disappeared when the same posture transformations were applied to
              the rubber hand. Mismatch between the stimulation delivered to
              the subject's hand and the rubber hand abolished the illusion.
              The combination of these two situations is of particular
              interest. When the subject's hand posture was slightly different
              from the rubber hand posture, the RHI remained as long as
              stimulation of the two hands was congruent in a hand-centred
              spatial reference frame, even though the altered posture of the
              subject's hand meant that stimulation was incongruent in external
              space. Conversely, the RHI was reduced when the stimulation was
              incongruent in hand-centred space but congruent in external
              space. We conclude that the visual-tactile correlation that
              causes the RHI is computed within a hand-centred frame of
              reference, which is updated with changes in body posture. Current
              sensory evidence about what is 'me' is interpreted with respect
              to a prior mental body representation.",

              hand being stroked while one's own unseen hand is synchronously

              Rubber hands 'feel' touch that eyes see. Nature, 391(6669), 756].
              As one has lost the veridical location of one's hand, one should
              not be able to correctly guide one's hand movements. An accurate
              representation of the location of body parts is indeed a
              necessary pre-requisite for any correct motor command [Graziano,

              investigated whether action is indeed affected by the
              proprioceptive drift towards the rubber hand, nor has the
              resistance of visual capture in the RHI to new proprioceptive
              information been assessed. In the present two kinematic
              experiments, we show for the first time that action resists the
              RHI and that the RHI resists action. In other words, we show a
              dissociation between illusion-insensitive ballistic motor
              responses and illusion-sensitive perceptual bodily judgments.
              Moreover, the stimulated hand was judged closer to the rubber
              hand for the perceptual responses, even after active movements.
              This challenges the view that any proprioceptive update through
              active movement of the stimulated hand erases the illusion. These

               millisecond-level timing precision in order to function

               array of applications, including operation in real-world
               environments, such timing requirements will need to be relaxed.
               In addition, overall BCI system design must be improved in order
               to better disambiguate the numerous, seemingly similar, neural
               responses that may arise in such environments. We argue that
               this new area of operational BCI will require the integration of
               neural data with non-neural contextual variables in order to
               function reliably. We propose a framework in which non-neural
               contextual information can be used to better scope the

               specific analyses as well as defining probability distributions

              Health Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative
              Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. Despite regulations and
              standard practices for conducting ethical research, researchers

              device studies. This article draws on, reviews, specifies, and

              matter expertise to address 3 specific ethical challenges in
              neural devices research: analysis of risk, informed consent, and
              posttrial responsibilities to research participants.
              OBSERVATIONS: Research with humans proceeds after careful
              assessment of the risks and benefits. In assessing whether risks
              are justified by potential benefits in both invasive and
              noninvasive neural device research, the following categories of
              potential risks should be considered: those related to surgery,
              hardware, stimulation, research itself, privacy and security, and
              financial burdens. All 3 of the standard pillars of informed
              consent-disclosure, capacity, and voluntariness-raise challenges
              in neural device research. Among these challenges are the need to
              plan for appropriate disclosure of information about atypical and
              emerging risks of neural devices, a structured evaluation of
              capacity when that is in doubt, and preventing patients from
              feeling unduly pressured to participate. Researchers and funders
              should anticipate participants' posttrial needs linked to study
              participation and take reasonable steps to facilitate continued
              access to neural devices that benefit participants. Possible
              mechanisms for doing so are explored here. Depending on the
              study, researchers and funders may have further posttrial
              responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This ethical
              analysis and points to consider may assist researchers,
              institutional review boards, funders, and others engaged in human
              neural device research.",

              presumed that it influences movement via descending tracts
              originating from the motor cortex. Here we show that neuronal

              cortex and other supraspinal locomotor centers. Stimulation of
              this pathway enhances speed of locomotion, while inhibition

  abstract = "AbstractSomatosensory brain-machine-interfaces (BMIs) can create
              naturalistic sensations by modulating activity of neural
              populations in the brain. By utilizing different spatial or
              temporal patterns of intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS) in
              primary sensory cortex (S1), human patients suffering
              somatosensory loss can experience both cutaneous and
              proprioceptive sensory feedback. As evidenced by motor deficits
              in deafferented patients, rapid somatosensory feedback is
              critical for dexterous motor ability, in part because visual
              feedback is much slower than naturally occurring somatosensory
              input. However, somatosensory BMI studies typically report
              significantly longer cognitive processing latencies for cortical
              electrical stimulation than for naturally occurring
              somatosensations or visual sensations.In this study, we show that
              multi-channel electrical stimulation patterns elicit naturalistic
              somatosensory percepts in a human tetraplegic participant.
              Crucially, somatosensations evoked by multi-channel ICMS are
              cognitively processed at comparable latencies to naturally evoked
              sensations and significantly faster than visual sensations, as
              measured via a simple reaction time test. Further investigation
              demonstrated multi-channel stimulation could significantly reduce
              minimum amplitude detection thresholds and such reductions in
              charge density resulted in more frequent ``natural'' sensation
              descriptors reported by the human participant. Multi-channel ICMS
              patterns also evoked percepts with highly stable somatotopic
              locations. While some single-channel ICMS patterns evoked
              sensations 20-80\% of the time, most multi-channel patterns could
              evoke sensations with 100\% repeatability, an important step in
              demonstrating BCI device reliability. These improvements are all
              significant advances towards state-of-the-art sensory BMIs. The
              addition of such low-latency artificial sensory feedback to motor
              BMIs is expected to improve movement accuracy and increase
              embodiment for human users.",

              from 2000 to 2010. METHODS: We linked fee-for-service Medicare
              claims to participants aged $\geq$70 from the nationally
              representative Health and Retirement Study. We classified
              dementia status using an algorithm with similar sensitivity and

              dementia diagnosis status using ICD-9-CM codes from Medicare

              risks of clinical under- and overdiagnosis between groups and
              over time. RESULTS: Non-Hispanic blacks had roughly double the
              risk of underdiagnosis as non-Hispanic whites. While primary

              lives of patients but the extent of underdetection worldwide and
              its causes are not known. This study aimed to quantify the
              prevalence of undetected dementia and to examine its correlates.
              METHODS/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A systematic search was conducted
              until October 2016 for studies reporting the proportion of
              undetected dementia and/or its determinants in either the
              community or in residential care settings worldwide.
              Random-effects models calculated the pooled rate of undetected
              dementia and subgroup analyses were conducted to identify
              determinants of the variation. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME
              MEASURES: The outcome measures of interest were the prevalence
              and determinants of undetected dementia. RESULTS: 23 studies were
              eligible for inclusion in this review. The pooled rate of
              undetected dementia was 61.7\% (95\% CI 55.0\% to 68.0\%). The
              rate of underdetection was higher in China and India (vs Europe
              and North America), in the community setting (vs
              residential/nursing care), age of <70 years, male gender and
              diagnosis by general practitioner. However, it was lower in the
              studies using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) diagnosis
              criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of undetected dementia is
              high globally. Wide variations in detecting dementia need to be
              urgently examined, particularly in populations with low
              socioeconomic status. Efforts are required to reduce diagnostic
              inequality and to improve early diagnosis in the community.",

              performed on 54 professional athletes who self-reported their
              history of concussion or non-concussion. Both groups completed a
              concussion symptom scale (SCAT5) before the measurement. We
              analyzed biosignals and CoP parameters before and after the
              platform movements, to compare the net response of individual
              postural control. The results showed that BioVRSea discriminated
              between the concussion and non-concussion groups. Particularly,
              EEG power spectral density in delta and theta bands showed
              significant changes in the concussion group and right soleus
              median frequency from the EMG signal differentiated concussed
              individuals with balance problems from the other groups.
              Anterior-posterior CoP frequency-based parameters discriminated
              concussed individuals with balance problems. Finally, we used
              machine learning to classify concussion and non-concussion,
              demonstrating that combining SCAT5 and BioVRSea parameters gives
              an accuracy up to 95.5\%. This study is a step towards
              quantitative assessment of concussion.",

               means to diagnose neurodegenerative pathologies such as
               Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD recognition can benefit from
               machine learning methods that, compared with traditional manual
               diagnosis methods, have higher reliability and improved
               recognition accuracy, being able to manage large amounts of
               data. Nevertheless, machine learning methods may exhibit lower
               accuracies when faced with incomplete, corrupted, or otherwise
               missing data, so it is important do develop robust
               pre-processing techniques do deal with incomplete data. The aim
               of this paper is to develop an automatic classification method
               that can still work well with EEG data affected by artifacts, as
               can arise during the collection with, e.g., a wireless system

  abstract = "Objective.Electroencephalography (EEG) is a potential source of
              downstream biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's
              disease (AD) due to its low-cost, noninvasive, and portable
              advantages. Accurately detecting AD-induced patterns from EEG
              signals is essential for understanding AD-related
              neurodegeneration at the EEG level and further evaluating the
              risk of AD at an early stage. This paper proposes a deep
              learning-based, functional explanatory framework that probes AD
              abnormalities from short-sequence EEG data.Approach.The framework
              is a learning-based automatic detection system consisting of
              three encoding pathways that analyze EEG signals in frequency,
              complexity, and synchronous domains. We integrated the proposed
              EEG descriptors with the neural network components into one
              learning system to detect AD patterns. A transfer learning-based
              model was used to learn the deep representations, and a modified
              generative adversarial module was attached to the model to
              overcome feature sparsity. Furthermore, we utilized activation
              mapping to obtain the AD-related neurodegeneration at brain
              rhythm, dynamic complexity, and functional connectivity
              levels.Main results.The proposed framework can accurately (100\%)
              detect AD patterns based on our raw EEG recordings without
              delicate preprocessing. Meanwhile, the system indicates that (a)
              the power of different brain rhythms exhibits abnormal in the
              frontal lobes of AD patients, and such abnormality spreads to
              central lobes in the alpha and beta rhythms, (b) the difference
              in nonlinear complexity varies with the temporal scales, and (c)
              all the connections of pair-wise brain regions except bilateral
              temporal connectivity are weak in AD patterns. The proposed
              method outperforms other related methods in detection
              performance.Significance.We provide a new method for revealing
              abnormalities and corresponding localizations in different
              feature domains of EEG from AD patients. This study is a
              significant foundation for our future work on identifying
              individuals at high risk of AD at an early stage.",

              researchers unfamiliar with the technique. The popular methods of
              finite difference and splines are reviewed in detail. The former
              has the advantage of simplicity and low computational cost, but
              its estimates are prone to a variety of errors due to
              discretization. The latter eliminates all issues related to
              discretization and incorporates a regularization mechanism to
              reduce spatial noise, but at the cost of increasing mathematical
              and computational complexity. These and several other issues
              deserving further development are highlighted, some of which we
              address to the extent possible. Here we develop a set of discrete
              approximations for Laplacian estimates at peripheral electrodes.
              We also provide the mathematical details of finite difference

              were obtained by summing scores from the individual CERAD
              subtests (excluding the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE])
              into a total composite (maximum score = 100). The method of
              tabulating the total score was constructed using normal controls
              (NCs; n = 424) and patients with AD (n = 835) from the CERAD
              registry database. The utility of the total score was further
              tested in independent samples of mild AD (n = 95), mild cognitive
              impairment (MCI; n = 60), and NC (n = 95) subjects. RESULTS: The
              CERAD total score was highly accurate in differentiating NC and
              AD subjects in the CERAD registry. Age, gender, and education
              effects were observed, and demographic correction scores were
              derived through multiple regression analysis. Demographically
              corrected CERAD total scores showed excellent test-retest
              reliability across samples (r = 0.95) and were highly correlated
              with the MMSE (r = 0.89) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (r =

               during the 3 years following lumbar puncture in a clinical,
               real-life setting. The secondary objective was to investigate
               the prognostic value of CSF biomarkers as continuous variables.
               Data from 228 patients (median age 67 (47--85) years), who
               presented at the Neurology Memory Clinic UZ/KU Leuven between
               September 2011 and December 2016, were included with a follow-up
               period of up to 36 months. Patients underwent a CSF AD biomarker
               test for amyloid-beta 1--42 (A$\beta$42), hyperphosphorylated
               tau (p181-tau) and total tau (t-tau) in the clinical work-up for
               diagnostic reasons. Patients were divided into ATN classes based
               on CSF biomarkers: A$\beta$42 for amyloid (A), p181-tau for tau
               (T), and t-tau as a measure for neurodegeneration (N). Based on
               retrospective data analysis, cognitive performance was evaluated

               statistical analysis was based on linear mixed-effects modeling
               (LME). The distribution in the current clinical sample was as
               follows: A−/T−/N− 32.02\%, A+/T−/N− 33.33\%, A+/T+/N+ 17.11\%,
               A+/T−/N+ 11.84\%, A−/T−/N+ 4.39\%, A−/T+/N+ 1.32\% (3 cases),
               with no cases in the A−/T+/N− and A+/T+/N− class. Hence, the
               latter 3 classes were excluded from further analyses. The change
               of MMSE relative to A−/T−/N− over a 36-month period was
               significant in all four ATN classes: A+/T+/N+ = − 4.78 points on
               the MMSE; A−/T−/N+ = − 4.76; A+/T−/N+ = − 2.83; A+/T−/N− = −
               1.96. The earliest significant difference was seen in the
               A+/T+/N+ class at 12 months after baseline. The effect of ATN
               class on future cognitive decline was confirmed for a different
               set of CSF thresholds. All individual baseline CSF biomarkers
               including the A$\beta$42/t-tau ratio showed a significant
               correlation with subsequent cognitive decline, with the highest
               correlation seen for A$\beta$42/t-tau. ATN classification based
               on CSF biomarkers has a statistically significant and clinically

               Unadjusted and covariate-adjusted differences in the percent of
               affirmative responses to follow-up discussion and an index,
               ranging from 0 to 3, that summed affirmative responses, were
               compared across respondents randomly assigned to self- versus
               other-framed vignettes. RESULTS: One thousand six hundred
               twenty-eight panel members (81.6\%) completed the survey (mean
               age, 72.3 [range, 65-102], 801 female [49.2\%] and 827 male
               [50.8\%]) with 796 (48.9\%) randomly assigned to vignettes about
               themselves and 832 (51.1\%) to vignettes about individuals of
               the same age. Percent affirming need for follow-up ranged from
               66.9\% to 90.5\% and was systematically lower for those
               randomized to vignettes about themselves. The differences ranged
               from -10.8 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI],
               -13.6 to -7.9 percentage points) for the most severe to -13.9
               percentage points (95\% CI, -18.1 to -9.7 percentage points) for
               the mildest memory-related problem vignettes. The summary index
               was -0.444 points (95\% CI, 0.563 to -0.326) or 0.491 of a
               standard deviation (95\% CI, 0.622$\sigma$ to -0.362$\sigma$)
               lower for scenarios about participants themselves relative to
               others. DISCUSSION: Seniors were more likely to recognize and
               recommend follow-up for memory-related problems affecting
               someone else than the same problems affecting themselves,
               suggesting symptom education alone may not improve rates of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Over 6 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease or
              Related Dementia (ADRD) but whether spikes in spending
              surrounding a new diagnosis reflect pre-diagnosis morbidity,
              diagnostic testing, or treatments for comorbidities is unknown.
              METHODS: We used the 1998-2018 Health and Retirement Study and
              linked Medicare claims from older ($\geq$65) adults to assess
              incremental quarterly spending changes just before versus just
              after a clinical diagnosis (diagnosis cohort, n = 2779) and, for
              comparative purposes, for a cohort screened as impaired based on
              the validated Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS)
              (impairment cohort, n = 2318). Models were adjusted for
              sociodemographic and health characteristics. Spending patterns
              were examined separately by sex, race, education, dual
              eligibility, and geography. RESULTS: Among the diagnosis cohort,
              mean (SD) overall spending was $4773 ($9774) per quarter - 43\%
              of which was spending on hospital care ($2048). In adjusted
              analyses, spending increased by $8400 (p < 0.001), or 156\%, from
              $5394 in the quarter prior to $13,794 in the quarter including
              the diagnosis. Among the cohort in which impairment was
              incidentally detected using the TICS, adjusted spending did not
              change from just before to after detection of impairment, from
              $2986 before and $2962 after detection (p = 0.90). Incremental
              spending changes did not differ by sex, race, education, dual
              eligibility, or geography. CONCLUSION: Large, transient spending
              increases accompany an ADRD diagnosis that may not be attributed
              to impairment or changes in functional status due to dementia.
              Further study may help reveal how treatment for comorbidities is
              associated with the clinical diagnosis of dementia, with
              potential implications for Medicare spending.",

              a surrogate endpoint for disease progression in a therapeutic
              trial for AD. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with probable AD
              from 38 different centers participated in the MRI portion of a
              52-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of milameline, a
              muscarinic receptor agonist. The therapeutic trial itself was not
              completed due to projected lack of efficacy on interim analysis;
              however, the MRI arm of the study was continued. Of the 362
              subjects who underwent a baseline MRI study, 192 subjects
              underwent a second MRI 1 year later. Hippocampal volume and
              temporal horn volume were measured from the MRI scans. RESULTS:
              The annualized percent changes in hippocampal volume (-4.9\%) and
              temporal horn volume (16.1\%) in the study patients were
              consistent with data from prior single-site studies. Correlations
              between the rate of MRI volumetric change and change in
              behavioral/cognitive measures were greater for the temporal horn
              than for the hippocampus. Decline over time was more consistently
              seen with imaging measures, 99\% of the time for the hippocampus,
              than behavioral/cognitive measures (p < 0.001). Greater
              consistency in MRI than behavioral/clinical measures resulted in
              markedly lower estimated sample size requirements for clinical
              trials. The estimated number of subjects per arm required to
              detect a 50\% reduction in the rate of decline over 1 year are:
              AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 320; Mini-Mental Status
              Examination 241; hippocampal volume 21; temporal horn volume 54.
              CONCLUSION: The consistency of MRI measurements obtained across
              sites, and the consistency between the multisite milameline data
              and that obtained in prior single-site studies, demonstrate the
              technical feasibility of using structural MRI measures as a
              surrogate endpoint of disease progression in therapeutic trials.

              cognitive markers prior to the clinical presentation of
              Alzheimer's disease (AD) will provide a template for
              understanding the underlying aetiology of the clinical syndrome
              and, concomitantly, for improving early diagnosis, clinical trial
              recruitment and treatment assessment. This study aims to
              characterise continuous changes of such markers and determine
              their rate of change and temporal order throughout the AD
              continuum. METHODS: The methodology is founded on the development
              of stochastic models to estimate the expected time to reach
              different clinical disease states, for different risk groups, and
              synchronise short-term individual biomarker data onto a disease
              progression timeline. Twenty-seven markers are considered,
              including a range of cognitive scores, cerebrospinal (CSF) and
              plasma fluid proteins, and brain structural and molecular imaging
              measures. Data from 2014 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease
              Neuroimaging Initiative database is utilised. RESULTS: The model
              suggests that detectable memory dysfunction could occur up to
              three decades prior to the onset of dementia due to AD (ADem).
              This is closely followed by changes in amyloid-$\beta$ CSF levels
              and the first cognitive decline, as assessed by sensitive
              measures. Hippocampal atrophy could be observed as early as the
              initial amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation. Brain hypometabolism starts
              later, about 14 years before onset, along with changes in the
              levels of total and phosphorylated tau proteins. Loss of
              functional abilities occurs rapidly around ADem onset.
              Neurofilament light is the only protein with notable early
              changes in plasma levels. The rate of change varies, with CSF,
              memory, amyloid PET and brain structural measures exhibiting the
              highest rate before the onset of ADem, followed by a decline. The
              probability of progressing to a more severe clinical state
              increases almost exponentially with age. In accordance with
              previous studies, the presence of apolipoprotein E4 alleles and
              amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation can be associated with an increased
              risk of developing the disease, but their influence depends on
              age and clinical state. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited
              longitudinal data at the individual level and the high
              variability observed in such data, the study elucidates the link
              between the long asynchronous pathophysiological processes and
              the preclinical and clinical stages of AD.",

              research focus towards early or preclinical stages of the
              disease. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is known to increase
              the risk of developing AD and several other negative outcomes.
              However, it is still very scarcely characterized and there is no
              neurophysiological study devoted to its individual classification
              which could improve targeted sample recruitment for clinical
              trials. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-two older adults (70 healthy
              controls, 91 SCD, and 91 MCI) underwent a magnetoencephalography
              scan. Alpha relative power in the source space was employed to
              train a LASSO classifier and applied to distinguish between
              healthy controls and SCD. Moreover, MCI participants were used to
              further validate the previously trained algorithm. RESULTS: The
              classifier was significantly associated to SCD with an AUC of
              0.81 in the whole sample. After randomly splitting the sample in
              2/3 for discovery and 1/3 for validation, the newly trained
              classifier was also able to correctly classify SCD individuals
              with an AUC of 0.75 in the validation sample. The regions
              selected by the algorithm included medial frontal, temporal, and
              occipital areas. The algorithm trained to select SCD individuals
              was also significantly associated to MCI diagnostic. CONCLUSIONS:
              According to our results, magnetoencephalography could be a
              useful tool for distinguishing individuals with SCD and healthy
              older adults without cognitive concerns. Furthermore, our
              classifier showed good external validity, being not only
              successful for an unseen SCD sample, but also in a different
              population with MCI cases. This supports its utility in the
              context of preclinical dementia. These findings highlight the
              potential applications of electrophysiological techniques to
              improve sample recruitment at the individual level in the context

               neural recording modalities such as EEG and functional MRI to
               explore the neural correlates of human behavior and cognition.
               Integration with implanted electrodes would enable significant

              long-term disability. Over the past decades, significant
              literature has accumulated demonstrating impairments in early
              auditory perceptual processes in schizophrenia. In this review,
              we first describe early auditory dysfunction in schizophrenia
              from both a behavioral and neurophysiological perspective and
              examine their interrelationship with both higher order cognitive
              constructs and social cognitive processes. Then, we provide
              insights into underlying pathological processes, especially in
              relationship to glutamatergic and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
              (NMDAR) dysfunction models. Finally, we discuss the utility of
              early auditory measures as both treatment targets for precision
              intervention and as translational biomarkers for etiological
              investigation. Altogether, this review points out the crucial
              role of early auditory deficits in the pathophysiology of

              intervention and auditory-targeted approaches.",

              presenile age. As for other subtypes of dementia, FTD incidence

              the population, and its recognition is now becoming a determinant
              for clinicians. FTD and psychiatric disorders can overlap in
              terms of clinical presentations by sharing a common genetic
              predisposition and neuropathological mechanism in some cases.
              Nonetheless, this association is often unclear and

              activity that will inhibit the spontaneous assembly in vitro of
              partially purified brain tubulin. The sensitivity of this
              inhibitory activity to ribonucleases but not to a variety of
              other hydrolytic enzymes indicates that the inhibitor is an RNA.
              This conclusion is supported by the observation that purified
              RNAs from sea urchins, chinese hamster ovary cells, and brain all
              inhibit spontaneous microtubule assembly in vitro. The synthetic
              polynucleotides [poly(A), (C), (G), and (U)] are also inhibitory.
              This inhibition, however, appears to be nonspecific since the RNA
              base composition is unimportant and a variety of other nonnucleic
              acid polyanions also function as inhibitors. The treatment of
              assembly competent tubulin preparations with an insoluble RNA in
              the form of poly(A) covalently linked to agarose beads produces a
              ``stripped'' tubulin which will not assemble microtubules unless
              a heat-stable, trypsin-sensitive fraction eluted with increased
              ionic strength is mixed with the ``stripped'' tubulin. Similar
              results can be obtained with other cation exchangers, including
              phosphocellulose and carboxymethylcellulose. The heat-stable
              protein sequestered by poly(A)-agarose appears to be identical to
              the ``tau'' factor recently described by Kirschner and coworkers.
              Reconstitution experiments indicate that there is a

              suggest that spontaneous assembly of microtubules in nonneural

              complexed with RNA. This idea is supported by the observation
              that the ratio of tubulin to RNA is low in cultured cell extracts

              Aim of our study was to evaluate specific visual subsystem
              involvement in a group of AD patients, recording isoluminant
              chromatic and luminance pattern electroretinograms and pattern
              visual evoked potentials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: data were
              obtained from 15 AD patients (9 females and 6 males, mean
              age+/-1SD: 77.6+/-4.01 years) not yet undergoing any treatment,
              and from 10 age-matched healthy controls. Diagnosis of probable
              AD was clinically and neuroradiologically established. PERGs were
              recorded monocularly in response to equiluminant red-green (R-G),
              blue-yellow (B-Y) and luminance yellow-black (Y-Bk) horizontal
              square gratings of 0.3c/deg and 90\% contrast, reversed at 1Hz.
              VEPs were recorded in response to full-field (14 deg)
              equiluminant chromatic R-G, B-Y and luminance Y-Bk sinusoidal
              gratings of 2c/deg, presented in onset (300ms)-offset (700ms)
              mode, at the contrast levels of 90\%. RESULTS: All data were
              retrieved in terms of peak-amplitude and latency and assessed
              using the Student's t-test for paired data. Temporal differences
              of PERGs and VEPs, evoked by Y-Bk grating in AD patients compared

              experience and advanced cognition. Despite this importance, it
              remains unknown how imagination is realized in the brain.
              Substantial research focusing on the hippocampus, a brain
              structure traditionally linked to memory, indicates that firing
              patterns in spatially tuned neurons can represent previous and
              upcoming paths in space. This work has generally been interpreted
              under standard views that the hippocampus implements cognitive
              abilities primarily related to actual experience, whether in the
              past (e.g. recollection, consolidation), present (e.g. spatial
              mapping) or future (e.g. planning). However, relatively recent
              findings in rodents identify robust patterns of hippocampal
              firing corresponding to a variety of alternatives to actual
              experience, in many cases without overt reference to the past,
              present or future. Given these findings, and others on
              hippocampal contributions to human imagination, we suggest that a
              fundamental function of the hippocampus is to generate a wealth
              of hypothetical experiences and thoughts. Under this view,
              traditional accounts of hippocampal function in episodic memory
              and spatial navigation can be understood as particular
              applications of a more general system for imagination. This view

              discriminant analysis (LDA) suffer from the limited number of
              available training samples. The singularity problem causes LDA to
              fail in small sample size (SSS) situations. Two dimensional
              linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) for feature extraction of
              hyperspectral images is proposed in this paper which has good
              efficiency with small training sample size. In this approach, the
              feature vector of each pixel of hyperspectral image is
              transformed into a feature matrix. As a result, the data matrices
              lie in a low-dimensional space. Then, the between-class and
              within-class scatter matrices are calculated using the matrix
              form of training samples. The proposed approach has two main
              advantages: it deals with the SSS problem in hyperspectral data,
              and also it can extract each number of features (with no
              limitation) from the original high dimensional data. The proposed
              method is tested on four widely used hyperspectral datasets.
              Experimental results confirm that the proposed 2DLDA feature
              extraction method provides better classification accuracy, with a
              reasonable computation time, compared to popular supervised

              analysis (GDA) and nonparametric weighted feature extraction
              (NWFE) particularly compared to the 1DLDA in the SSS situation.
              The experiments show that two dimensional linear discriminant

              histological dataset (n= 1 rhesus macaque) obtained 848 and 590 d
              after implantation in two brain hemispheres. For 2 of 4 arrays

               affected by AD, MCI, and healthy controls (HC). Notably, we
               compute the power intensity for each high- and low-frequency
               band, using their absolute differences to distinguish among the
               three classes of subjects by means of different supervised
               machine learning methods. We use EEG recordings from a cohort of
               105 subjects (48 AD, 37 MCI, and 20 HC) referred for dementia to
               the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi ``Bonino-Pulejo'' of Messina, Italy.
               The findings show that this method reaches 97\%, 95\%, and 83\%
               accuracy when considering binary classifications (HC vs. AD, HC
               vs. MCI, and MCI vs. AD) and an accuracy of 75\% when dealing
               with the three classes (HC vs. AD vs. MCI). These results
               improve upon those obtained in previous studies and demonstrate
               the validity of our approach. Finally, the efficiency of the
               proposed method might allow its future development on embedded
               devices for low-cost real-time diagnosis.",

              leading to formation of Abeta plaques in the brain. This process
              occurs while individuals are still cognitively normal. Biomarkers

  abstract  = "Abstract Background Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is sometimes
               preceded by a less severe decline in cognitive abilities called
               mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Having affordable and
               non-invasive biomarkers of MCI would ease diagnosis, improve
               prognosis, and open up possibilities to delay the transition to
               AD. One potential biomarker is alpha oscillations measured with
               electroencephalography (EEG) that have been found to differ
               between cognitively intact older adults (OA) and people with AD.
               To find whether these changes can already be detected in MCI, we
               reviewed studies that compared alpha power and functional
               connectivity in people with MCI and OA, in people with MCI and
               people with AD, and in people with MCI who progress to AD and
               those who do not. Method We searched for records published until
               24 January 2020 using search terms ?mild cognitive impairment?
               AND (eeg OR oscillations). 65 studies were included in the
               review. We conducted four random effects meta-analyses. We
               compared resting state power in people with MCI and OA in the
               full alpha band (? 8-12 Hz; k=5; n=198 MCI, 258 OA), in lower
               alpha frequencies (? 8-10 Hz; k=5; n=196 MCI, 203 OA), and in
               upper alpha frequencies (? 10-12 Hz; k=5; n=131 MCI, OA 139). We
               also compared resting state power in the full alpha band in
               people with AD and people with MCI (k=6; n=481 AD, 499 MCI).
               Result In the full alpha band, resting state power was lower in
               people with AD than in people with MCI (ES=-0.30, 95\% CI=-0.51,
               -0.10, p=0.003), and in people with MCI than in OA (ES=-1.49,
               95\% CI=-2.69, -0.29, p=0.02). Reviewing the literature showed
               that resting state alpha power is lower in people with MCI who
               eventually progress to AD than in those who do not. During task
               performance, alpha activity changed less in people with MCI than
               in OA. Studies that compared functional connectivity between the
               three groups reported inconsistent results. Conclusion Lower
               resting state alpha power, that has been found in people with AD
               can, though to a lesser degree, also be detected in people with
               MCI, especially those who are on a trajectory towards AD.",

               individuals will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) to
               facilitate enrollment in clinical trials. Hippocampal volume
               (HV) considered as a fundamental structure for cognition is one
               of the key emerging imaging markers to improve Alzheimer?s
               disease risk prediction. There are numerous examples of HV
               reduction among patients with AD and those at risk for AD.
               However most evidence is derived from research cohorts or
               clinical populations with short follow-up, and the extent to
               which hippocampal degeneration predict long-term AD remains
               somewhat unclear. Moreover, hippocampus being damaged by a
               variety of stimuli including nutrition, sleep, inactivity,
               stress and depressive symptoms, it may also play a role on mild
               cognitive decline in the context of normal aging. To address
               this issue we studied the long term association between HV and
               the risk of 1) incident dementia and 2) mild cognitive decline
               in normal aging. Method We studied 510 dementia-free persons
               from the ESPRIT cohort, aged over 65 years. All participants
               underwent magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T) at baseline. We
               used both manual and automated methods (Freesurfer 6.0) to
               measure HV. A cognitive test battery (global cognition, visual
               memory, executive function, verbal fluency) was performed, and
               participants were followed by neurologists for incident dementia
               at 2, 4, 7, 10, 12 and 15 years. We tested the association
               between HV and the risk of dementia and mild cognitive decline
               using respectively Cox proportional hazards and linear mixed
               models. Result 42 participants developed AD. After adjustment by
               potential confounder (age, sex, education, ApoE4, depression,
               antidepressive drugs, alcohol, sleep, baseline MMSE score,
               intracranial volume) right and left HV were significantly
               associated with dementia (p<0.01) but also with mild cognitive
               decline in normal aging (p<0.02). Conclusion In a
               community-dwelling population, we report evidence that HV
               predict both long term incident dementia and mild cognitive
               decline in normal ageing casting doubt on the utility of this
               structure as an early biomarker of AD using only a single
               measure. However, this measure could be used in general

               primary and secondary aims assessing analytical validity (Phases
               1-2), clinical validity (Phases 3-4) and clinical utility (Phase
               5). This framework allows us to assess current evidence and
               identify requirements, gaps, and research priorities towards
               Phase-5 validity. While using this methodology to assess the
               validation status of biomarkers of tau pathology we revised this
               methodology consistently with progresses in AD research. Method
               First, we critically appraised the adequacy of the 2017
               Biomarker Roadmap to assess tau biomarkers and relative to the
               current biomedical perspective of AD (e.g., A/T/N framework).
               Second, we proposed and discussed the adaptations at a workshop
               (Geneva, November 11-12, 2019) convening the Alzheimer?s
               Association and 8 leading AD biomarker research groups, tasked
               with assessing the validity of CSF-, plasma- and imaging-tau
               biomarkers for AD according to the updated Biomarker Roadmap
               framework. Result The 2019 updates apply to tau as well as other
               biomarkers and include: Phase 3: a greater variety of study
               designs (e.g., cross-sectional in addition to longitudinal) and
               reference standards (e.g., AD biomarker confirmation in addition
               to clinical progression) deemed appropriate to appraise the
               evidence on tau biomarkers; Phases 1-5:evidence appraisal
               examining quality of evidence in addition to target results.
               Most urgent research priorities for both tau and other
               biomarkers are to: Define specific clinically- and
               patient-relevant outcomes with all pertinent stakeholders
               (patients, caregivers, clinicians, regulators), to prepare
               proper studies on clinical utility and implementation;
               Produce/adapt specific reporting guidelines facilitating
               methodological compliance, reporting and assessment of the
               produced evidence. Conclusion We have revised the Biomarker
               Roadmap accommodating biomarkers of tau pathology. This revision
               improves the methodology also for the other AD biomarkers. To
               further boost their validation up to Phase-5 studies, the
               available evidence should be assessed by methodologists not
               directly involved in the assessed studies, possibly through
               dynamic data sharing on accessible platforms. Compliance with
               this methodology is essential to implement tau biomarkers

               (?280,000) Americans with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) develop
               symptoms at age 65 or younger and are classified as having
               early-onset AD (EOAD). Although EOAD and late-onset AD (LOAD)
               share the same pathologic substrate, there are notable
               differences in their clinical and biological phenotypes. The
               Longitudinal Early-onset AD study (LEADS) is a multi-site,
               observational clinical and biomarker study of EOAD. In the
               present study we utilized the currently available LEADS imaging
               data to explore the spatial extent and magnitude of
               neurodegeneration EOAD Method 95 amyloid positive patients with
               EOAD, 37 amyloid negative cognitively impaired patients
               (EOnonAD) , and 55 cognitively unimpaired controls (CNs) were
               included in the analysis. The magnitude of cortical thinning in
               the EOAD and EOnonAD groups was estimated using whole-brain GLMs
               compared to the CN group. In addition, w-scores were derived for
               each EOAD patient for these ROIs: average cortical thickness,
               hippocampal volume, AD-signature cortical thickness (typically
               used in LOAD), and precuneus cortical thickness controlling for
               age, sex, and acquisition site. The utility of each ROI to
               differentiate EOAD patients from CNs was assessed by calculating
               the percentage of patients falling below a W-threshold of -1.5.
               Result In EOAD, a distributed pattern of cortical thinning was
               observed in lateral temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex
               (p<.01), and was most prominent in the precuneus (Cohen?s d? =
               1.5). In the EOnonAD group, cortical thinning was observed but
               was highly variable across individuals. The w-score analysis in
               the EOAD group yielded the following results: Mean Cortical
               thickness: Mean = -3.34, SD = 2.97, Classification = 72\%.;
               Hippocampal volume: Mean = -2.96, SD = 2.39, Classification =
               74\%; AD Signature: Mean = -4.63, SD = 3.07, Classification =
               80\%; Precuneus: Mean = -5.98, SD = 4.1, Classification = 90\%.
               Conclusion Our results are consistent with previous findings
               demonstrating cortical thinning in lateral parietal, precuneus,
               and lateral temporal lobes in EOAD with relatively less
               involvement of the medial temporal lobes. Our results also
               suggest that the precuneus may be especially vulnerable to
               neurodegeneration in patients with EOAD and may serve as a
               useful biomarker for patient classification.",

               resonance imaging (MRI), are known to be associated with
               cognitive impairment and dementia. Previous studies have shown
               spatial heterogeneity of WMH appearance, but the contribution of
               Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia and related genetic risk factors
               to this heterogeneity remains unclear. We sought to investigate
               the heterogeneity of WMH, in the general population, leveraging
               state of the art pattern analysis methods and exploring whether
               the APOE genotype is contributing to this heterogeneity. Method
               A sample of N=1836 people was obtained from the Study of Health
               in Pomerania (SHIP), Germany, covering a wide age range (22?84
               years, median age 52.2$\pm$13.16). WMH were automatically
               segmented on multi-modal MRI scans and decomposed into four
               spatially distinctive components using Non-Negative Matrix
               Factorization (NNMF), a machine-learning based structural
               covariance method. Associations of these components with the
               APOE genotype (available for n=303) was investigated in subjects
               older than 60 years of age, using a multivariable linear
               regression model for each component, with WMH component loadings
               as the outcome variable and APOE genotype (encoded as shown in
               Table 1) as the independent variable. Age, sex and ship
               sub-cohort were included as covariates. All reported P-values
               were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. Result
               Data-driven approach identified four WMH components, consistent
               with clinical categorization in deep and periventricular
               lesions, while further dividing periventricular WMH into
               posterior, frontal and dorsal components (Figure 1). APOE
               genotype was significantly associated with the dorsal
               periventricular WMH component (P=0.035, Bonferroni corrected),
               but not with the other three WMH components (Table 1).
               Conclusion We obtained a high consistency of data-driven WMH
               components and established clinical categorizations. Our data
               demonstrated that the appearance of WMH follows heterogeneous
               regional distribution patterns. Additionally, the APOE genotype,
               the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, is
               specifically associated with one of the components indicating
               spatial specificity and a potential link to early MRI changes in
               the predementia phase.",

               invasive, and have limited accessibility. In this respect, the
               current study aims to identify and compare predictability of MRI
               markers with neuropsychological markers for accurate prediction
               of cerebral A? status in AD cohort through machine learning (ML)
               approaches. Methods Predictability of the candidate markers for
               cerebral A? status was examined by analyzing 724 participants
               from the ADNI-2 cohort at baseline visit (170 control subjects,
               95 with SMC, 324 with MCI and 135 with AD; mean age 73.2 years,
               range 55?90). Demographic variables (age, gender, education, and
               APOE status), structural MRI markers (cortical thickness and
               volume), and neuropsychological test scores were used as input
               in several ML algorithms. Cerebral A? burden was measured using
               florbetapir PET images. We first calculated the predictability
               of each ML model, and the adaptive LASSO algorithm with 10-fold
               cross validation was implemented to identify the relative
               predictability of predictors in the selected model. Results ML
               models with MRI markers predicted cerebral A? status with the
               85\% predictability. Out of five combination of candidate
               markers, neuropsychological markers with demographics showed the
               most cost-efficient result compared to MRI methods. The adaptive
               LASSO model with out-of-sample classification was able to
               distinguish abnormal levels of A? based on significantly
               predictable features. The AUC was 0.85 in the ADNI-2 cohort,
               indicating the same performance with MRI-based models.
               Conclusions Our results are twofold: the result has first
               identified the predictability in MRI markers using ML
               approaches, and secondly demonstrated the neuropsychological
               model with demographics could predict A? positivity, suggesting
               a more cost-efficient method for detecting cerebral A? status
               compared to MRI markers. More specifically, with advantages in
               cost and its non-invasive procedure, the method could be
               utilized as a brief screening tool in AD risk population for

  abstract  = "Abstract Background Prognosis for Alzheimer?s disease is
               difficult, with rates of disease progression varying widely.
               Despite the extensive use of clinical dementia severity
               assessment scales to determine dementia diagnosis and to monitor
               progression, there is no consensus on which imaging factors may
               accurately predict future decline trajectories on these
               measures. Determination of baseline imaging patterns that are
               related to slower, or faster, decline rates could be used to
               identify those at highest risk of worse outcomes and inform care
               planning. Method Decline trajectories were estimated from the
               Alzheimer?s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset which
               contains clinical, imaging, and biological assessment records
               for 1,736 patients followed-up over 8 years at 3, 6, or 12 month
               intervals. Clusters of similar decline trajectories were
               identified for patients with relevant baseline
               fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
               imaging data (N=530) using mini-mental state examination (MMSE),
               clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer?s
               disease assessment scale (ADAS-13), and functional activities
               questionnaire (FAQ) assessment scores. Decline trajectories
               allocated to slow, intermediate, and fast clusters were further
               analysed to find significant associations with PET imaging
               features using statistical parametric mapping (SPM12). Result
               When compared to cognitively normal non-decliners, slow,
               intermediate and fast cluster groups showed similar topographic
               patterns of hypometabolism on FDG-PET for all four clinical
               assessments (p<0.05 family-wise error corrected). Slow
               progressors showed focal hippocampal hypometabolism, which
               extended into parietotemporal, inferior parietal and precuneal
               regions for intermediate progressors. Fast progressors showed
               more extensive hypometabolism in similar regions with additional
               superior frontal hypometabolism. Although locational deficits
               were similar on cognitive measures for decline groups, CDR-SB
               showed the greatest hypometabolism extent for slow progressors,
               followed by FAQ, then ADAS-13, with MMSE showing the least.
               Conclusion Our results suggest a single pattern of pathological
               progression of functional degeneration in Alzheimer?s disease,
               with slow, intermediate and fast progressors at different time
               points on the same decline trajectory. This progression begins
               with focal medial temporal regional abnormalities, extending to
               parietotemporal, inferior parietal and precuneus regions, before
               finally involving the superior frontal lobe. CDR-SB was the most

  abstract  = "Abstract Background The current diagnostic criteria allow the
               use of amyloid biomarkers (either CSF or PET) to provide
               pathophysiological support for the diagnosis of AD. How these
               criteria should be operationalized by clinicians is unclear. We
               previously developed a model to select patients in which CSF
               measurements have added value [1]. Now, we study whether the
               model can also be used to select patients for amyloid PET.
               Method We included 348 subjects (223 controls, 125 Alzheimer?s
               disease dementia) from ADNI2, with available neuropsychology,
               MRI and Florbetapir PET. Positive (AD like) and negative
               (normal) amyloid PET were simulated to estimate whether
               knowledge of amyloid status would impact (confidence in)
               diagnosis. These simulated markers were added to available
               demographic, neuropsychology and MRI data in each patient to see
               whether the diagnostic confidence increased. If the confidence
               exceeded a predefined cut-off (probability of correct class
               (PCC)$\geq$0.80), then the patient was selected for amyloid PET
               (computerized decision support approach). We compared this
               approach with proportion of PET scans and patients diagnosed
               with sufficient confidence (PCC $\geq$0.80) based on an
               algorithm without amyloid PET (only neuropsychology and MRI),
               and amyloid PET for all patients (see Figure 1). Result The
               computerized decision support approach recommended amyloid PET
               in 11\%, which yielded a diagnosis with sufficient confidence in
               75\% of all patients. This approach was most efficient when
               compared to amyloid PET in none (0\% amyloid, 71\% diagnosed),
               or amyloid PET for all (100\% amyloid, 71\% diagnosed). Results
               were comparable for CSF instead of amyloid PET. Conclusion The
               previous developed computerized decision support approach showed
               favorable results in selecting patients for amyloid PET testing.
               In this clear-cut comparison between controls and AD, amyloid
               PET adds little over clinical measures ? but a similar framework
               may help to support decision making in more realistic and
               challenging clinical situations. Expansion of this study is
               needed with a real life cohort consisting of patients with
               different types of dementia. In this way, the approach can
               support clinicians in making a balanced decision in ordering
               additional biomarker testing. Reference: (1) Rhodius-Meester HFM

               memory clinics for mild forgetfulness, leading to the increased
               use of health care resources. Nowadays, about 25\% of memory
               clinics patients complain of cognitive decline in absence of
               objective deficits (subjective cognitive decline,SCD), and they
               are expected to increase in the coming years. Some patients with
               SCD later develop cognitive impairment and dementia, often due
               to AD, but the majority have psychiatric conditions, physical
               diseases, polypharmacy, or normal brain ageing. Differentiating
               these potential causes is often a difficult exercise even for

               reports in order to identify possible aetiologies of the
               cognitive complaint. Results In the whole sample (age,
               mean$\pm$SD:71$\pm$7years; 54\% female; education:16.3$\pm$4.1;
               MMSE:28.8$\pm$0.8; 24\% A+) age is inversely correlated with
               episodic memory (Free-and-cue-selective-reminding-test, p=0.003)
               and positively with medial temporal lobe atrophy scale
               (p=0.017). Amyloid SUVr correlates negatively with episodic
               memory performance (p<0.05). On the other hands, the clinicians
               found 3 different aetiologies of the SCD: Comorbidity (stroke,
               brain injury, cardio-vascular risk factors, physical
               disability,...), Psychopathology (depression, anxiety,
               personality trait); Unknown (apparently, no reason associated to
               the complaint). The prevalence of the 3 groups is

               ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. A
               specific metabolic imaging biomarker of AD - Alzheimer?s
               disease-related pattern (ADRP) has been previously identified
               from 2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
               (2-[18F]FDG-PET) scans of clinically diagnosed AD patients,

               analysis (SSM/PCA) 1?3. However the clinical diagnosis may be
               wrong in substantial number of cases 4. We aimed to identify
               ADRP on patients with Alzheimer?s pathological changes in
               cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid and to validate it in an independent
               group of AD and other dementia patients and compare it to the
               original ADRP 1. Method 2-[18F]FDG-PET scans from 20 AD1 and 20
               normal controls (NC1) were used for pattern identification.
               Additional 110 scans were analyzed for validation: 68 from AD

              is excessively synchronized in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Previous
              work using invasive intracranial recordings and non-invasive
              scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has shown that correlations
              between beta phase and broadband gamma amplitude (i.e.,
              phase-amplitude coupling) are elevated in PD, perhaps a
              reflection of this synchrony. Recently, it has also been shown,
              in invasive human recordings, that nonsinusoidal features of beta
              oscillation shape also characterize PD. Here we show that these
              features of beta waveform shape also distinguish PD patients on
              and off medication using non-invasive recordings in a dataset of
              15 PD patients with resting scalp EEG. Specifically, beta
              oscillations over sensorimotor electrodes in PD patients off
              medication had greater sharpness asymmetry and steepness
              asymmetry than on medication (sign rank, p=0.006, p=0.003
              respectively). We also showed that beta oscillations over
              sensorimotor cortex most often had a canonical shape and that
              using this prototypical shape as an inclusion criterion increased
              the effect size of our findings. Together our findings suggest
              that novel ways of measuring beta synchrony that incorporate
              waveform shape could improve detection of PD pathophysiology in
              non-invasive recordings.",

              measures as potential biomarkers for the detection and assessment
              of cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
              Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neurophysiological biomarkers of AD
              derived from EEG and FDG-PET, once characterized and validated,
              would expand the set of existing diagnostic molecular biomarkers
              of AD pathology with associated biomarkers of disease progression
              and neural dysfunction. Since symptoms of AD often begin to
              appear later in life, successful identification of EEG-based
              biomarkers must account for age-related neurophysiological
              changes that occur even in healthy individuals. To this end, we
              collected EEG data from individuals with AD (n = 26), MCI (n =
              53), and cognitively normal healthy controls stratified by age
              into three groups: 18-40 (n = 129), 40-60 (n = 62) and 60-90 (=
              55) years old. For each participant, we computed power spectral
              density at each channel and spectral coherence between pairs of
              channels. Compared to age matched controls, in the AD group, we
              found increases in both spectral power and coherence at the
              slower frequencies (Delta, Theta). A smaller but significant
              increase in power of slow frequencies was observed for the MCI
              group, localized to temporal areas. These effects on slow
              frequency spectral power opposed that of normal aging observed by
              a decrease in the power of slow frequencies in our control
              groups. The AD group showed a significant decrease in the
              spectral power and coherence in the Alpha band consistent with
              the same effect in normal aging. However, the MCI group did not
              show any significant change in the Alpha band. Overall, Theta to
              Alpha ratio (TAR) provided the largest and most significant
              differences between the AD group and controls. However,
              differences in the MCI group remained small and localized. We
              proposed a novel method to quantify these small differences
              between Theta and Alpha bands' power using empirically derived
              distributions of spectral power across the time domain as opposed
              to averaging power across time. We defined Power Distribution
              Distance Measure (PDDM) as a distance measure between probability
              distribution functions (pdf) of Theta and Alpha power. Compared
              to average TAR, using PDDF enhanced the statistical significance,
              the effect size, and the spatial distribution of significant
              effects in the MCI group. We designed classifiers for
              differentiating individual MCI and AD participants from
              age-matched controls. The classification performance measured by
              the area under ROC curve after cross-validation were AUC = 0.85
              and AUC = 0.6, for AD and MCI classifiers, respectively.
              Posterior probability of AD, TAR, and the proposed PDDM measure

              prevalence in modern society. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is
              considered a transitional stage between normal aging and AD;
              however, not all subjects with MCI progress to AD. Prediction of
              conversion to AD at an early stage would enable an earlier, and
              potentially more effective, treatment of AD.
              Electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers would provide a
              non-invasive and relatively cheap screening tool to predict
              conversion to AD; however, traditional EEG biomarkers have not
              been considered accurate enough to be useful in clinical
              practice. Here, we aim to combine the information from multiple
              EEG biomarkers into a diagnostic classification index in order to
              improve the accuracy of predicting conversion from MCI to AD
              within a 2-year period. We followed 86 patients initially
              diagnosed with MCI for 2 years during which 25 patients converted
              to AD. We show that multiple EEG biomarkers mainly related to
              activity in the beta-frequency range (13-30 Hz) can predict
              conversion from MCI to AD. Importantly, by integrating six EEG
              biomarkers into a diagnostic index using logistic regression the

              individual biomarkers, with a sensitivity of 88\% and specificity
              of 82\%, compared with a sensitivity of 64\% and specificity of

              approach implemented in the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox
              (http://www.nbtwiki.net/). We suggest that this approach can be
              used to identify optimal combinations of biomarkers (integrative
              biomarkers) also in other modalities. Potentially, these

              preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of
              Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an
              initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's
              Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This
              unifying update is labeled a ``research framework'' because its
              intended use is for observational and interventional research,
              not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and
              Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease
              (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can
              be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers.
              The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the
              disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which
              shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to
              a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the
              diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are
              grouped into those of $\beta$ amyloid deposition, pathologic tau,
              and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system
              groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the
              pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in
              that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N)
              groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when
              they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and
              cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures.
              However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive
              schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a
              scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a
              six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this
              framework seeks to create a common language with which
              investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the
              interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by
              biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern
              that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to
              be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and
              inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical
              practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to
              restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not
              use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not
              available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the
              specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the
              document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be
              considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive
              impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is
              fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study.
              Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse
              populations. Although it is possible that $\beta$-amyloid plaques
              and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD
              pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define
              AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different
              disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD
              as a biological construct will enable a more accurate
              characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that
              lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well
              as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also
              will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials
              where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process
              and in the appropriate people.",

              Retinal changes involving the structure and function of the
              ganglion cell layer are increasingly documented in both
              established and prodromal AD. Visual event-related potentials
              (vERP) are sensitive to dysfunction in the magno- and
              parvocellular visual systems, which originate within the retinal
              ganglion cell layer. The present study evaluates vERP as a
              function of amyloid deposition in aging, and in mild cognitive
              impairment (MCI). METHODS: vERP to stimulus-onset, motion-onset,
              and alpha-frequency steady-state (ssVEP) stimuli were obtained
              from 16 amyloid-positive and 41 amyloid-negative healthy elders

              approaches. Social cognition was assessed in a subset of

  abstract = "Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder that affects
              approximately 1\% of the population worldwide. Cognitive deficits
              are a key feature of the disorder and a primary cause of
              long-term disability. Over the past decades, significant
              literature has accumulated demonstrating impairments in early
              auditory perceptual processes in schizophrenia. In this review,
              we first describe early auditory dysfunction in schizophrenia
              from both a behavioral and neurophysiological perspective and
              examine their interrelationship with both higher order cognitive
              constructs and social cognitive processes. Then, we provide
              insights into underlying pathological processes, especially in
              relationship to glutamatergic and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
              (NMDAR) dysfunction models. Finally, we discuss the utility of
              early auditory measures as both treatment targets for precision
              intervention and as translational biomarkers for etiological
              investigation. Altogether, this review points out the crucial
              role of early auditory deficits in the pathophysiology of
              schizophrenia, in addition to major implications for early
              intervention and auditory-targeted approaches.",

              schizophrenia and predict conversion to schizophrenia (Sz) among
              individuals at symptomatic clinical high risk (CHR). Impairments
              in MMN index dysfunction at both subcortical and cortical
              components of the early auditory system. To date, the large
              majority of studies have been conducted using deviants that
              differ from preceding standards in either tonal frequency (pitch)
              or duration. By contrast, MMN to sound location deviation has
              been studied to only a limited degree in Sz and has not
              previously been examined in CHR populations. Here, we evaluated
              location MMN across Sz and CHR using an optimized, multi-deviant
              pattern that included a location-deviant, as defined using
              interaural time delay (ITD) stimuli along with pitch, duration,
              frequency modulation (FM) and intensity deviants in a sample of
              42 Sz, 33 CHR and 28 healthy control (HC) subjects. In addition,
              we obtained resting state functional connectivity (rsfMRI) on CHR
              subjects. Sz showed impaired MMN performance across all deviant
              types, along with strong correlation between MMN deficits and
              impaired neurocognitive function. In this sample of largely
              non-converting CHR subjects, no deficits were observed in either
              pitch or duration MMN. By contrast, CHR subjects showed
              significant impairments in location MMN generation particularly
              over right hemisphere and significant correlation between
              impaired location MMN and negative symptoms including
              deterioration of role function. In addition, significant
              correlations were observed between location MMN and rsfMRI
              involving brainstem circuits. In general, location detection
              using ITD stimuli depends upon precise processing within midbrain
              regions and provides a rapid and robust reorientation of
              attention. Present findings reinforce the utility of MMN as a
              pre-attentive index of auditory cognitive dysfunction in Sz and
              suggest that location MMN may index brain circuits distinct from
              those indexed by other deviant types.",

  abstract = "Humans are voracious imaginers, with internal simulations
              supporting memory, planning and decision-making. Because the
              neural mechanisms supporting imagery overlap with those
              supporting perception, a foundational question is how reality and
              imagination are kept apart. One possibility is that the intention
              to imagine is used to identify and discount self-generated
              signals during imagery. Alternatively, because internally
              generated signals are generally weaker, sensory strength is used
              to index reality. Traditional psychology experiments struggle to
              investigate this issue as subjects can rapidly learn that real
              stimuli are in play. Here, we combined one-trial-per-participant
              psychophysics with computational modelling and neuroimaging to
              show that imagined and perceived signals are in fact intermixed,
              with judgments of reality being determined by whether this
              intermixed signal is strong enough to cross a reality threshold.
              A consequence of this account is that when virtual or imagined
              signals are strong enough, they become subjectively
              indistinguishable from reality.",

              levels on screening positron emission tomography (PET) scans:
              intermediate amyloid ($\approx$20 to 40 Centiloids) for A3 and
              elevated amyloid (>40 Centiloids) for A45. Both trials are being
              conducted under a single protocol, with a shared screening
              process and common schedule of assessments. A3 is a Phase 2 trial
              with PET-imaging end points, whereas A45 is a Phase 3 trial with
              a cognitive composite primary end point. The treatment period is
              4 years. The study utilizes innovative approaches to enriching
              the sample with individuals who have elevated brain amyloid.
              These include recruiting from the Trial-Ready Cohort for
              Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer's disease (TRC-PAD), the
              Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) Registry, and the Japanese
              Trial Ready Cohort (J-TRC), as well as incorporation of plasma
              screening with the C2N mass spectrometry platform to quantitate
              the A$\beta$ 42/40 ratio (A$\beta$ 42/40), which has been shown
              previously to reliably identify cognitively normal participants
              not likely to have elevated brain amyloid levels. A blood sample
              collected at a brief first visit is utilized to ``screen out''
              individuals who are less likely to have elevated brain amyloid,
              and to determine the participant's eligibility to proceed to PET
              imaging. Eligibility to randomize into the A3 Trial or A45 Trial
              is based on the screening PET imaging results. RESULT: The focus
              of this article is on the innovative design of the study.
              DISCUSSION: The AHEAD 3-45 Study will test whether with lecanemab
              (BAN2401) can slow the accumulation of tau and prevent the
              cognitive decline associated with AD during its preclinical
              stage. It is specifically targeting both the preclinical and the
              early preclinical (intermediate amyloid) stages of AD and is the
              first secondary prevention trial to employ plasma-based
              biomarkers to accelerate the screening process and potentially
              substantially reduce the number of screening PET scans.",

              amplification assays (SAAs) have the potential to differentiate
              people with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls. We used
              the well characterised, multicentre Parkinson's Progression
              Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort to further assess the diagnostic
              performance of the $\alpha$-synuclein SAA and to examine whether
              the assay identifies heterogeneity among patients and enables the
              early identification of at-risk groups. METHODS: This
              cross-sectional analysis is based on assessments done at
              enrolment for PPMI participants (including people with sporadic
              Parkinson's disease from LRRK2 and GBA variants, healthy
              controls, prodromal individuals with either rapid eye movement
              sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) or hyposmia, and non-manifesting
              carriers of LRRK2 and GBA variants) from 33 participating
              academic neurology outpatient practices worldwide (in Austria,
              Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands,
              Norway, Spain, the UK, and the USA). $\alpha$-synuclein SAA
              analysis of CSF was performed using previously described methods.
              We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the
              $\alpha$-synuclein SAA in participants with Parkinson's disease
              and healthy controls, including subgroups based on genetic and
              clinical features. We established the frequency of positive
              $\alpha$-synuclein SAA results in prodromal participants (RBD and
              hyposmia) and non-manifesting carriers of genetic variants
              associated with Parkinson's disease, and compared
              $\alpha$-synuclein SAA to clinical measures and other biomarkers.
              We used odds ratio estimates with 95\% CIs to measure the
              association between $\alpha$-synuclein SAA status and categorical
              measures, and two-sample 95\% CIs from the resampling method to
              assess differences in medians between $\alpha$-synuclein SAA
              positive and negative participants for continuous measures. A
              linear regression model was used to control for potential
              confounders such as age and sex. FINDINGS: This analysis included
              1123 participants who were enrolled between July 7, 2010, and
              July 4, 2019. Of these, 545 had Parkinson's disease, 163 were
              healthy controls, 54 were participants with scans without
              evidence of dopaminergic deficit, 51 were prodromal participants,
              and 310 were non-manifesting carriers. Sensitivity for
              Parkinson's disease was 87·7\% (95\% CI 84·9-90·5), and
              specificity for healthy controls was 96·3\% (93·4-99·2). The
              sensitivity of the $\alpha$-synuclein SAA in sporadic Parkinson's
              disease with the typical olfactory deficit was 98·6\%
              (96·4-99·4). The proportion of positive $\alpha$-synuclein SAA
              was lower than this figure in subgroups including LRRK2
              Parkinson's disease (67·5\% [59·2-75·8]) and participants with
              sporadic Parkinson's disease without olfactory deficit (78·3\%
              [69·8-86·7]). Participants with LRRK2 variant and normal
              olfaction had an even lower $\alpha$-synuclein SAA positivity
              rate (34·7\% [21·4-48·0]). Among prodromal and at-risk groups, 44
              (86\%) of 51 of participants with RBD or hyposmia had positive
              $\alpha$-synuclein SAA (16 of 18 with hyposmia, and 28 of 33 with
              RBD). 25 (8\%) of 310 non-manifesting carriers (14 of 159 [9\%]
              LRRK2 and 11 of 151 [7\%] GBA) were positive. INTERPRETATION:
              This study represents the largest analysis so far of the
              $\alpha$-synuclein SAA for the biochemical diagnosis of
              Parkinson's disease. Our results show that the assay classifies
              people with Parkinson's disease with high sensitivity and
              specificity, provides information about molecular heterogeneity,
              and detects prodromal individuals before diagnosis. These
              findings suggest a crucial role for the $\alpha$-synuclein SAA in
              therapeutic development, both to identify pathologically defined
              subgroups of people with Parkinson's disease and to establish
              biomarker-defined at-risk cohorts. FUNDING: PPMI is funded by the

              and mortality among civilian and military populations. Most
              available treatments have limited efficacy, particularly in
              disorders where symptoms vary over relatively short time scales.
              Targeted modulation of neural circuits, particularly through
              open-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS), showed initial promise
              but has failed in blinded clinical trials. We propose a new
              approach, based on targeting neural circuits linked to functional
              domains that cut across diagnoses. Through that framework, which
              includes measurement of patients using six psychophysical tasks,
              we seek to develop a closed-loop DBS system that corrects
              dysfunctional activity in brain circuits underlying those
              domains. We present convergent preliminary evidence from
              functional neuroimaging, invasive human electrophysiology, and
              human brain stimulation experiments suggesting that this approach
              is feasible. Using the Emotional Conflict Resolution (ECR) task
              as an example, we show that emotion-related networks can be
              identified and modulated in individual patients. Invasive and
              non-invasive methodologies both identify a network between
              prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala.
              Further, stimulation in cingulate and amygdala changes patients'
              performance in ways that are linked to the task's emotional
              content. We present preliminary statistical models that predict
              this change and allow us to track it at a single-trial level. As
              these diagnostic and modeling strategies are refined and embodied
              in an implantable device, they offer the prospect of a new

  abstract  = "Abstract Background Event-related-potentials (ERPs) during
               cognitive tasks are sensitive measures of cognitive decline
               [1]-[2] and could quantitatively measure the trajectory of
               disease progression or response to clinical interventions. In
               this longitudinal study, we aimed to compare ERPs between
               individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls,
               and to demonstrate the test-retest reliability of ERP measures
               to assess their potential utility for future observational
               studies and treatment trials. Methods Participants included
               individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=31) and
               healthy controls stratified by age: HC2 (n=46, 40-60 yrs.), HC3
               (n=56, 60-90 yrs.). ERPs during attention, image recognition,
               and verbal memory tasks were recorded using a wireless EEG to
               determine amplitudes and latencies of the P200 and late positive
               potential (LPP) ERP components in response to target (memorized)
               and non-target (novel) stimuli. Differences between MCI and HC3
               groups were characterized at the initial visit, and longitudinal
               changes in ERP components were determined at 1-year follow-up
               for both groups. Reliability of ERP measures was demonstrated by
               computing intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) measures of
               test-retest variability in all healthy controls (HC2 and HC3)
               from initial visit to 1-year follow-up. Results At the initial
               visit, the MCI group demonstrated reduced LPP amplitude
               (Hedges-g=0.8, p=10-3) and delayed P200-latency (Hedges-g=0.89,
               p=10-4) when compared to HC3. Reliability in healthy controls
               was high for LPP (0.85 and 0.75 for target and non-target
               stimuli, respectively) and moderate for P200-latency (0.67 and
               0.53 for target and non-target stimuli, respectively), without
               longitudinal changes after 1-year follow-up. Individuals with
               MCI demonstrated increased P200-latency (Hedges-g= 1.05, p=0.02,

               quantifiable memory ERP deficits at baseline with detectable
               change in the P200 component at 1-year follow-up, demonstrating
               that ERPs are sensitive measures for quantifying mild cognitive
               impairment. Test-retest reliability of these measures was good
               or moderate after 1-year, supporting their feasibility for

              decline in HIV patients. METHODS: EEG was acquired using a
              mobile/wireless 9-channel system in 39 persons with HIV, with
              well-controlled immune function and 63 healthy control
              participants (HCs) during three ERP tasks: sustained attention,
              focused attention, and divided attention. RESULTS: The HIV-group
              evidenced smaller late positive potential (LPP) and larger P200
              amplitudes across the tasks compared to the HC group. P200
              amplitude was correlated (r = 0.56) with the estimated duration
              of infection. Both groups showed higher P200 and LPP amplitudes
              in response to infrequent stimuli; this effect was not
              significantly different between groups. In the sustained

  abstract = "Cognitive and behavioral processes are often accompanied by
              changes within well-defined frequency bands of the local field
              potential (LFP i.e., the voltage induced by neuronal activity).
              These changes are detectable in the frequency domain using the
              Fourier transform and are often interpreted as neuronal
              oscillations. However, aside some well-known exceptions, the
              processes underlying such changes are difficult to track in time,
              making their oscillatory nature hard to verify. In addition, many
              non-periodic neural processes can also have spectra that
              emphasize specific frequencies. Thus, the notion that spectral
              changes reflect oscillations is likely too restrictive. In this
              study, we propose a simple yet versatile framework to understand
              the frequency spectra of neural recordings. Using simulations, we
              derive the Fourier spectra of periodic, quasi-periodic and
              non-periodic neural processes having diverse waveforms,
              illustrating how these attributes shape their spectral
              signatures. We then show how neural processes sum their energy in
              the local field potential in simulated and real-world recording
              scenarios. We find that the spectral power of neural processes is
              essentially determined by two aspects: 1) the distribution of
              neural events in time and 2) the waveform of the voltage induced
              by single neural events. Taken together, this work guides the
              interpretation of the Fourier spectrum of neural recordings and
              indicates that power increases in specific frequency bands do not
              necessarily reflect periodic neural activity. \#\#\# Competing

              consequences of health status on physical, mental, and social
              domains. Parkinson's disease is a complex disorder that strongly
              affects patients' quality of life. Several health-related quality
              of life tools have been used in Parkinson's disease. A Movement
              Disorder Society Task Force was commissioned to rate the
              psychometric quality of available health-related quality of life
              scales as applied to Parkinson's disease. Following the
              methodology adopted by previous work of the Movement Disorder
              Society Task Force, a review of generic and specific
              health-related quality of life scales applied in studies on
              Parkinson's disease was completed. Considering the scales from 3
              perspectives-use in Parkinson's disease, use by multiple research
              groups, and clinimetric properties-a final classification as
              ``recommended,'' ``suggested,'' or ``listed'' was applied to each
              reviewed instrument. Four generic scales (EuroQoL, Nottingham
              Health Profile, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and Sickness
              Impact Profile) and 5 specific scales (39-Item Parkinson's
              Disease Questionnaire, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire Short
              Form, Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire,
              Parkinson's Impact Scale, and Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's
              Disease-Psychosocial) reached the level of ``recommended.'' The
              39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire is the most thoroughly
              tested and applied questionnaire. Three other generic measures
              (Quality of Life Questionnaire 15D, Schedule for the Evaluation
              of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting, and World Health
              Organization Quality of Life Assessment Short Version) and the
              specific Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Scale are
              ``suggested.'' With a little additional effort in completing the
              stipulated requirements, they could reach the ``recommended''
              level. At present there is a wide variety of health-related
              quality of life measures for application in the Parkinson's
              disease setting, and the task force does not recommend the
              development of a new scale. Selection of the most appropriate

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: We used a functional MRI paradigm involving
              conventional vs. unconventional views of objects to assess
              bottom-up vs. top-down visual processing in Parkinson's disease
              (PD) with normal cognition, PD with mild cognitive impairment
              (MCI), and MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) as compared to
              healthy controls. We particularly aimed at determining whether
              the task discriminated between PD with and without MCI and
              between two MCI groups due to distinct pathologies (AD and PD).
              METHODS: 116 right-handed subjects (21 MCI due to AD; 16 PD with
              normal cognition; 24 PD with MCI; 55 healthy controls) performed
              a visual object-matching task in a T MR scanner. T statistic maps
              were computed to contrast task-based activation during
              unconventional vs. conventional view conditions. One-way ANOVAs
              and post hoc tests were performed to assess differences across
              and between groups. RESULTS: Both MCI groups performed worse than
              controls in the unconventional views condition and showed reduced
              activation of right anterior cingulate cortex and right superior
              parietal lobule (PD with MCI), and right middle and inferior
              frontal gyri (MCI due to AD). Neural responses in cortical areas
              within the ventral and dorsal visual pathway appeared to be
              preserved in both MCI groups. Receiver operating characteristic
              analysis of MRI contrast in the right superior parietal lobule
              distinguished PD with and without MCI with 87.50\% sensitivity
              and 86.98\% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired recognition of
              objects presented in unconventional orientations in MCI due to PD
              and AD was associated with decreased activation of frontoparietal
              regions, consistent with defective top-down regulation of visual
              processing. Aberrant activation of superior parietal cortex may
              serve as an early imaging biomarker of impending cognitive
              impairment in PD.",

              Disease Psychosis (PDP) raise the question of whether a specific
              profile of impaired cognition and visual function is linked to
              vulnerability to visual hallucinations (VHs). Previous studies
              have limited sample sizes and only included a sub-sample of
              tests. This is the first meta-analysis quantifying
              visuo-cognitive impairments in PDP patients across a spectrum of
              tests and taking into account potential confounding factors such
              as levodopa medication, illness duration and general cognitive
              ability. OBJECTIVE: Compare visual processing and cognitive
              performance between PD patients with and without VHs (PDVH and
              PDnoVH). METHODS: Four databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, Scopus,
              WebOfScience) were searched for studies on visual and/or
              cognitive performance of PDnoVH and PDVH published up to 02/2020.
              For each task, means and SDs were extracted and
              standardized-mean-differences (SMDs) between-groups calculated.
              Effect-sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated for all comparisons and
              synthesized in random-effects meta-analyses with
              robust-variance-estimation (accounting for multiple correlated
              measures within each study per cognitive/visual domain).
              Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger
              intercept. RESULTS: N = 99 studies including 2508 PDVH patients
              (mean age 68.4 years) and 5318 PDnoVH (mean age 66.4 years) were
              included in the seven meta-analyses. PDVH patients performed
              worse than PDnoVH across all measures of cognition and visual
              processing, with the greatest between-group effect-sizes in
              executive functions, attention, episodic memory and visual
              processing. Study characteristics were not significantly
              associated with between-group differences in the domains
              investigated. Age-differences were significantly associated with
              performance differences in general cognition, working memory and
              executive functions. CONCLUSION: Models of PDVH need to
              incorporate a wider range of cognitive and processing domains
              than currently included. There is a need for studies
              disentangling the temporal relationship between cognitive/visual
              deficits and VHs as early identification of risk before the onset
              of VHs could mitigate later outcomes such as progression to
              dementia.",

               comparing the effects of hardware and recording conditions on
               the integrity of the recordings. Analytical validation includes
               checking the accuracy and reliability of data processing and

               reliability, demographic variability, and comparing measures to

               include diagnosis, disease progression, or response to
               treatment. For each of these sections, we provide

              is unclear whether less segregated brain networks facilitate
              connectivity-mediated tau spreading. METHODS: We combined resting
              state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with
              longitudinal tau positron emission tomography (PET) in 42
              betamyloid-negative controls and 81 amyloid beta positive
              individuals across the AD spectrum. Network segregation was
              determined using resting-state fMRI-assessed connectivity among
              400 cortical regions belonging to seven networks. RESULTS: AD
              subjects with higher network segregation exhibited slower
              brain-wide tau accumulation relative to their baseline entorhinal
              tau PET burden (typical onset site of tau pathology). Second, by
              identifying patient-specific tau epicenters with highest baseline
              tau PET we found that stronger epicenter segregation was
              associated with a slower rate of tau accumulation in the rest of
              the brain in relation to baseline epicenter tau burden.
              DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that tau spreading is
              facilitated by a more diffusely organized connectome, suggesting
              that brain network topology modulates tau spreading in AD.
              HIGHLIGHTS: Higher brain network segregation is associated with
              attenuated tau pathology accumulation in Alzheimer's disease
              (AD). A patient-tailored approach allows for the more precise
              localization of tau epicenters. The functional segregation of

              prognostic value for cognitive decline and dementia is unclear.
              METHODS: Temporal relationships of SCD, DS and memory decline
              were examined by latent difference score modeling in a high-aged,
              population-based cohort (N = 3217) and validated using
              Cox-regression of dementia-conversion. In 334 cognitively

              population-based cohort, SCD preceded DS. High DS were associated
              with increased risk of dementia conversion in individuals with
              SCD. In SCD-patients from memory-clinics, high DS were associated
              with greater cognitive decline. CSF A{\ss}42 predicted increasing

              dementia. SCD-patients from memory-clinics with DS may constitute
              a high-risk group for cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Subjective
              cognitive decline (SCD) precedes depressive symptoms (DS) as
              memory declines. Emerging or persistent DS after SCD reports
              predict dementia. In SCD patients, more amyloid pathology relates

  author   = "Arvanitakis, Zoe and Shah, Raj C and Bennett, David A",
  abstract = "IMPORTANCE: Worldwide, 47 million people live with dementia and,
              by 2050, the number is expected to increase to 131 million.
              OBSERVATIONS: Dementia is an acquired loss of cognition in
              multiple cognitive domains sufficiently severe to affect social
              or occupational function. In the United States, Alzheimer
              disease, one cause of dementia, affects 5.8 million people.
              Dementia is commonly associated with more than 1 neuropathology,
              usually Alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular pathology.
              Diagnosing dementia requires a history evaluating for cognitive
              decline and impairment in daily activities, with corroboration
              from a close friend or family member, in addition to a thorough
              mental status examination by a clinician to delineate impairments
              in memory, language, attention, visuospatial cognition such as
              spatial orientation, executive function, and mood. Brief
              cognitive impairment screening questionnaires can assist in
              initiating and organizing the cognitive assessment. However, if
              the assessment is inconclusive (eg, symptoms present, but normal
              examination findings), neuropsychological testing can help
              determine whether dementia is present. Physical examination may
              help identify the etiology of dementia. For example, focal
              neurologic abnormalities suggest stroke. Brain neuroimaging may
              demonstrate structural changes including, but not limited to,
              focal atrophy, infarcts, and tumor, that may not be identified on
              physical examination. Additional evaluation with cerebrospinal
              fluid assays or genetic testing may be considered in atypical
              dementia cases, such as age of onset younger than 65 years, rapid
              symptom onset, and/or impairment in multiple cognitive domains
              but not episodic memory. For treatment, patients may benefit from
              nonpharmacologic approaches, including cognitively engaging
              activities such as reading, physical exercise such as walking,
              and socialization such as family gatherings. Pharmacologic
              approaches can provide modest symptomatic relief. For Alzheimer
              disease, this includes an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as
              donepezil for mild to severe dementia, and memantine (used alone
              or as an add-on therapy) for moderate to severe dementia.
              Rivastigmine can be used to treat symptomatic Parkinson disease
              dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Alzheimer disease currently
              affects 5.8 million persons in the United States and is a common
              cause of dementia, which is usually accompanied by other
              neuropathology, often cerebrovascular disease such as brain
              infarcts. Causes of dementia can be diagnosed by medical history,
              cognitive and physical examination, laboratory testing, and brain
              imaging. Management should include both nonpharmacologic and
              pharmacologic approaches, although efficacy of available
              treatments remains limited.",

               high accuracy in classifying gaze-driven versus gestural head
               movement (F1-Score: 0.89). We demonstrate the utility of the
               classifier with three applications: gestural input while
               avoiding unintentional input by Head-Gaze; target selection with
               Head-Gaze while avoiding Midas Touch by head gestures; and
               switching of cursor control between Head-Gaze for fast
